    <h1> Day 88: Memes and Dreams (30th April 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      In the morning I just handed in the group project documents, continued with my maths assignment and yeah. Nothing crazy. <br>
      I did see my friend at Greggs though which was a funny coincidence. <br>
      Together with his friend, we went to class and wow it was so dead and dry. <br>
      I already forgot what we even did. <br>
      Then I literally signed into the programming class and waved goodbye to the lecturer because there was genuinely no need to be in that class. <br>
      She‚Äôs chill. Hopefully I have her next year but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely. <br>
      Finally for the maths lab session I just helped Homi out with the document formatting and almost finished a question. <br>
      Not bad at all. Especially as we were laughing at memes halfway through. <br>
      I got turned into a meme edit. Damn. <br>
      Technically there‚Äôs still two more weeks of university after this. (Study week, then assessment week) <br>
      Tomorrow is basically my last day for this year. Staying on until the bitter end üòù. <br>
      I definitely want to see my university friends over summer because that‚Äôs a fun thing to do. <br>
      But the future is still uncertain... <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 89: The End‚Ä¶? </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing new learnt material wise, it was just a recap of what we‚Äôve done over the past few months. Fun. <br>
      Then I went with some friends for a walk around Canterbury. Kinda like how I did at the very start of the year. <br>
      Symmetry, my friend. We eventually settled at someone's student accommodation and I watched them get trashed on in Valorant. <br>
      Then I was with another friend for the final lesson, which was essentially just finishing off some bits for an assignment. <br>
      Then I was just continuing my maths assignment. It‚Äôs like 80% done. <br>
      But yeah, this is my final time I gotta be here for this academic year. Kinda crazy. <br>
      I think I‚Äôm gonna visit Homi and the rest of the university squad when I‚Äôm free and bored during summer. <br>
      I  haven‚Äôt decided how and what I‚Äôm actually going to do during it. <br>
      I still have my student ambassador job role, so that‚Äôs an option. <br>
      So yeah, none of these university blog posts for a long while. <br>
      I also have my driving lessons to be doing too. <br>
      I got goals and things to be working towards. <br>
      But I have been working on my own custom website that hosts every single blog post, all the way from September 2023. <br>
      It‚Äôs a personal project of mine, I guess. <br>
      Artists know what I‚Äôm talking about when you do something just to keep your skills in check. <br>
      And this website is it! Months in the making :D <br>
