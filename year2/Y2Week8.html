    <h1> Welcome Week Part 1: Pizza and Peace </h1>
    <p>
      My first four hours was spent helping out the ambassador team with welcome week. <br>
      It was pretty dead to be honest. <br>
      Most students were interested in their actual welcome week schedule than ‚ÄúHook the Duck‚Äù. <br>
      The person I was with though was quite nice and friendly. <br>
      Then I had free pizza in the outside area. <br>
      Like the university has a massive pizza oven they use for big events. <br>
      They were basically feeding me for free :P. <br>
      (I‚Äôm not technically a new student, but pfft free is free so who cares?) <br>
      I also got a free peach ice tea drink and it was really nice and refreshing. <br>
      I also saw one of the StressLess champion volunteers... but she seemed preoccupied so yeah. <br>
      The rest of the day was spent working in the clearing team. <br>
      It sometimes gets busy and stressful but there‚Äôs always help available so it‚Äôs good. <br>
      I‚Äôm pretty sure clearing ends for some courses in October so I‚Äôll probably be doing that until then. <br>
      Call me Mr Krabs because I like money. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Welcome Week Part 2: Newfound Friend </h1>
    <p>
      Once again my day was spilt. Did a few hours helping out in the student union, getting some pictures for the university instagram account. <br>
      Also talking to some new first year students. The other StressLess champion was there too. <br>
      She actually graduated yesterday so I congratulated her of course. <br>
      I guess the torch is getting passed down to me now. <br>
      Like Deku and All Might. <br>
      I showed the new guy the way to the big library and kinda gave him a mini campus tour too. Aren‚Äôt I nice? üôÇ<br>
      Then some more working, today wasn‚Äôt too painful but it‚Äôs the same couple of questions now. <br>
      I managed to make a single clearing offer so that‚Äôs neat. <br>
      After that I met up with my mate and we had a meal at the pub. <br> 
      Pretty solid day, but pretty tiring too‚Ä¶ <br>
