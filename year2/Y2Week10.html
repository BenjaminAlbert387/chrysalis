    <h1> Day 3: The New Course Rep?! (2nd October 2024)  </h1>
    <p>
      I did some work in the morning, but it’s not relevant or important to be honest. <br>
      Or exciting. Work is just work, right? <br>
      Clock in, do your job, clock out… <br>
      Class was interesting as usual. <br>
      Our lecturer is very active and jumpy which is better than falling asleep mid way through. <br>
      And it got me thinking about placement years. <br>
      Last year I didn’t get course rep, I didn’t get a single vote and I just looked like a lemon to be honest. <br>
      However because last year’s course rep switched over to software engineering, it left a gap. <br>
      Nobody else wanted to do it so…I offered. <br>
      I was kinda hoping someone would challenge me but nope. <br>
      Literally given for free. And loads of people voted for me, even people that didn’t do my course?! <br>
      I didn’t know I was that well liked. <br>
      I’ll do my best, I gotta. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 4: (Net)Work Hard, Play Harder  </h1>
    <p>
      Morning is nothing exciting, I get a croissant from Greggs and then continue with some work until the afternoon. <br>
      I do cop a margarita twist wrap from the cafeteria. They’re pretty good and filling. <br>
      We had our first networking class today and it was alright. <br>
      Our lecturer is quite chill and not bouncing off the walls. <br>
      It was a lot of new content though which was cool. <br>
      kinda the point of being at university yknow? <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 5: Fried Friday </h1>
    <p>
      Am I cooked? Maybe. Possibly. Potentially. <br>
      At least I show up for my classes unlike the other half of the students. <br>
      It was quite funny seeing students who weren’t in last week. <br>
      We learnt a bit more about algorithms and how computer scientists are actually just really pessimistic all the time. <br>
      Talking about worst case scenarios and stuff. <br>
      Definitely a “glass half empty” vibe. <br>
      After some lunch I did some more work, then afternoon lab time. <br>
      It’s actually a blessing in disguise since we managed to get the software working for computer networks. <br>
      With a few command lines in the terminal you can see where and how to attack people. <br>
      With great power comes great accountability or something? <br>
