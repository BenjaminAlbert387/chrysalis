    <h1> Day 12: Return of the Academic Weapon (22nd October 2024)  </h1>
    <p>
      It’s punishment time! And my punishment is doing assignments :P <br>
      But for real though, I like the vibes in the library. <br>
      It’s so cozy and peaceful and I won’t have random people distracting me from my work. <br>
      I did six hours overall and I’m pretty happy with the results. <br>
      It’s a long way to go but sometimes the hardest part is starting. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 13: To Be A Course Rep! </h1>
    <p>
      It’s not every day you get free pizza from the university! <br>
      (They really have Domino’s wrapped around their finger) <br>
      And of course the course rep training was good and informative too. <br>
      We did a quiz and I almost won it…got the last question wrong so I placed second. How tragic. <br>
      Apart from that I spent some more time doing my assignment. <br>
      That’s kinda the point of this week right? <br>
      If people want to treat it like a half term and mess around, their issue not mine. <br>
      I can’t screw up this opportunity so I won’t. <br>
      I’ll do it to those close to me…I won’t let them down! <br>
      *Future me here. Wow, calm down anime protagonist. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 14: Friends in High and Low Places </h1>
    <p>
      Another day, another couple hours of getting work done at the library. <br>
      I’m pretty proud of myself disciplining and time management. <br> 
      And other stuff that they ask for in interviews. <br>
      After that I met up with some of my uni friends as he was off the past week (He had tonsillitis). <br>
      I didn’t mind helping him revise for our upcoming test. Pretty scary when I say it like that. <br>
      I then paid for his McDonald’s because I wasn’t gonna let him go hungry. <br>
      Plus I owed him from before when we went out for lunch as he offered. <br>
      Then we ate and yeah we’re both in a much better position than we were yesterday. <br>
      Him because he actually knows the content. <br>
      Me because being able to explain it to someone else is proof you’ve understood it too. <br>
      Then while I’m waiting for the train…someone unexpected shows up?! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 15: Filler Arc </h1>
    <p>
      All I did was continue with my assignment… <br>
      I don’t really know what else I can talk about? <br>
      Academic Development Week is where nothing is timetabled. <br>
      So it’s just a week where you do whatever. <br>
      Meet up with friends, rediscover old ones, that kinda stuff. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>  Day 16: Trip Drip </h1>
    <p>
      Another trip 🤩 aren’t I lucky? <br>
      (Not really, actually they undersold the tickets as the coach we’re on isn’t even full) <br>
      I had to get up at quarter to 5. Jeez. <br>
      Felt like sixth form getting up really early for no reason expect to talk to a girl halfway across the world. <br>
      Lockdown really messed with our heads huh. Anyways whatever, I get the earliest train possible and arrive all fine. <br>
      In reality, we didn’t leave until almost an hour later. <br>
      We were legit just waiting for one person?! Kinda selfish to be honest. <br>
      The email even said “anyone late we’re leaving you” but I guess they sweet talked their way out of it. <br>
      We first went to this super cool sports lab where they basically test cutting edge stuff to help Team GB win in the Olympics. <br>
      And they use advanced technology to do it, I don’t think your normal phone has the power to calculate the pressure point of each individual body part. <br>
      There’s actually a lot of effort done just to make someone a second faster. <br>
      After that we headed off to a tunnel. It’s pretty secure and mysterious but that’s because they test super cars inside it. <br>
      There’s even an entire control room with tech and they have a fully functional garage. <br>
      We even went in the tunnel (at a safe speed of 60mph, not exactly world record pace). <br> 
      Then we got something to eat (I just had some fries) and the service station even had a claw machine and gambling area. <br>
      Pretty neat. <br>
      And we’re heading back. We were supposed to be back at 5pm. <br>
      It’s half 7 and I’m still on this damn coach. <br>
      If only we didn’t get delayed, maybe we’d back by now?! Some people honestly… <br>
      Edit: We got back at 19:50. Finally. <br>
      At least I managed to binge watch half an anime, get some maps completed in BTD6 and take some cool pictures. <br>
      But I think we’d all rather be home. <br>
      It’s been so long we had to have a driver change to comply with legal requirements. <br>
