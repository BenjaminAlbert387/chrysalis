    <h1> Day 6: Scholar? I Hardly Know Her! (9th October 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      I probably should though, Google Scholar is where all the academic (aka good) resources are. <br>
      Except the articles and books and journals are so long. <br>
      If only there was a way to search within them… <br>
      Or perhaps get a super smart AI to summarise information with insane accuracy? <br>
      We pretty much learnt about how to write an academic piece of work. <br>
      No matter how cooked I am, I won’t fall to the levels of ChatGPT for essay writing. <br>
      I also learned to be very careful opening drinks of sparkling water so it doesn’t go all over your leg. <br>
      (It wasn’t even my drink, perks of being helpful I guess?!) <br>
      I had McDonald’s, had a moment emailing my lecturers about my assignments. <br>
      That was not a fun email to type out because I get so worried about wording things, then did my other job. <br>
      All in all, not a bad day. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 7: Design and Despair </h1>
    <p>
      It’s almost the end of Clearing! Which means no more working for me, at least for a while. <br>
      I’ll still have to do student ambassador stuff as I want to get paid for my SCE award thing. <br>
      The rest of my day was basically talking to my friends and attending class. <br>
      We’re doing a networking module which is somewhat interesting at least. <br>
      There’s a lot of business-y stuff too, which I didn’t expect. <br>
      It’s like the meme of “Pick 2 between Study, Social and Sleep”. <br>
      You truly can’t have it all in the networking world… <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 8: Sometimes It Just (net)Works Out  </h1>
    <p>
      Not much happened in the morning, I mean we was actually doing fun stuff coding in Java. <br>
      It’s basically like another language, the same way football and soccer are pretty much the same thing. <br>
      And algorithms. <br>
      Did some more work and then I had another practical session in the afternoon. <br>
      I locked in pretty hard. Hell, I was even helping other students with troubleshooting which was quite funny. <br>
      I guess it shows I actually learnt it if I can do it without needing a script or tutorial. <br>
      Now to play the new video game I ordered! <br>
