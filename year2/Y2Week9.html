    <h1> Day 1: Welcome to Paradise </h1>
    <p>
      I decided to get into university early to see if I had anything to do with the Blackboard system. <br>
      I didn’t but I wanted to go in anyways since it’s probably more productive doing my website than doing Fortnite xp missions. <br>
      As I walked out of the library I saw a familiar face…someone from the department I (temporarily) work in! <br> 
      I hadn’t seen him in a while so he’s definitely starting his third year now. <br>
      Like all the other students who I work with I guess… <br>
      After a brief catch up with everyone we went to our classes. <br> 
      Our lecturer is…eccentric to say the least. <br>
      But he means well and he just wants us to get a high grade not just for this year, but for next year too. <br>
      I had to wait for my mate to use the restroom when the first lecture ended so I sorta just awkwardly waited around. <br>
      At least I got some pretty useful information about placement years. Like a secret bonus reward. <br>
      The friend trio is back too, and they’re all keeping well. <br>
      Most people just worked during the summer which is fair enough. <br>
      More money = more fun = less stress. <br>
      It’s like basic economics, bro. <br>
      I have some boring uni stuff to sort out when I get back. <br>
      And they’re really cracking down on skipping classes now. <br>
      Apparently it got so bad last year now they’re straight up withdrawing students that aren’t turning up. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 2: Are We Cooked? </h1>
    <p>
      9am class on a Friday. One sentence horror material right there. <br>
      But the scarier part was that genuinely half the class did not turn up for the first lecture of the module. <br>
      That’s pretty bad surely? <br>
      We didn’t really do much as it was an introduction and getting to know people. <br>
      Someone in my class recognised me from sixth form so that was awkward as I had no clue who they were. <br>
      We did a bit of group discussion but with half a class it was a bit tough. <br>
      After a pepperoni cheese twist from the cafe area (I think it’s new?) I worked for the rest of the day. <br>
      Nothing too exciting now to be honest. <br>
