    <h1>  Day 17: Java? I Hardly Know Her‚Ä¶ </h1>
    <p>
      9am on a Monday?! Call me Garfield because wow that is so tragic. <br>
      Actually don‚Äôt, I think lasagna is bad. <br>
      It‚Äôs so gooey and slimey and bleh I eat like a child. Cry about it. <br>
      We did some coding in Java because it‚Äôs almost like our second assessment is a coding task in Java. <br>
      I also saw one of my few ‚Äúcore‚Äù university friends which is nice. The rest don‚Äôt come in today, how lucky. <br>
      All I did afterwards was have some lunch and then continued working on my assignment. <br>
      I‚Äôm gonna run into that problem where I‚Äôve explained everything ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in fear of not explaining it enough. <br>
      So I need to get creative and cut down on the word count so it‚Äôs succinct. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 18: Project-ors </h1>
    <p>
      Got our second assessment sent to us today. <br>
      It‚Äôs‚Ä¶actually not too bad. <br>
      We have to do a lot of academic writing but it‚Äôs gonna help us a lot with the final year project. <br>
      I was with my friends which was nice. <br>
      Before the lecture I was just doing some assignment work and revision. ‚ú® <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 19: Halloween! Fortnitemares!  </h1>
    <p>
      The future is brite‚Ä¶for me? <br>
      At least I hope so. I cosplayed as Brite Bomber from Fortnite. <br>
      Apparently I have ‚Äúmassive balls‚Äù for doing that but it‚Äôs just for a day. <br>
      Jeez, no need for the dramatic stuff. <br>
      I really didn‚Äôt do anything exciting, just some work. <br>
      I also got asked to take part in helping with a final year‚Äôs project, and obviously I said yes. <br>
      Not everyday that happens. <br>
      Went into class and some people appreciated my cosplay. <br>
      Some just looked at me funny and most people didn‚Äôt even show up. <br>
      Stayed for a little bit then I saw a familiar face yet again. <br>
      But at this point my social battery was pretty low so yeah‚Ä¶ <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 20: Amalgamation </h1>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm in early as usual doing assignment work. <br>
      I did a solid chunk of hours towards the two reports I currently have so I‚Äôm happy in terms of that. <br>
      I also did a ‚Äúlevel 3‚Äù Mind map for revision purposes. <br>
      Before all that though, I actually had a video interview for a placement year opportunity. <br>
      I want to do one. I‚Äôve decided that a while ago to be honest but yeah, it seems the best thing for me. <br>
      A year with pure work‚Ä¶ <br>
      After that I got McDonald‚Äôs and then met up with some of my uni friends. <br>
      They do a different module to be so I can‚Äôt really help. Luckily ChatGPT can for them. <br>
      I mean what? Just kidding :P <br>
      I also participated in a research project, like the ones they do for your final year. <br>
      Had to sign some forms but it was actually really cool. And different. <br>
      Got some sweets too, I‚Äôm gonna experience a sugar crash tonight ü§£ <br>
      Oh and I guess I had my lecture too. Fun. <br>
