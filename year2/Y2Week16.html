    <h1> Day 24: Flame On (11th November 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Well this week my train wasn’t actually late Monday morning so that’s automatically a good thing. <br>
      Class was fine until the fire alarm went off. Wasn’t even a test one or anything. <br>
      It legit just went and happened. <br>
      At least I handed in my first assignment of this academic year! Only loads more to go… <br>
      Got some lunch at the library. <br> 
      (I was too lazy going into town and I’m even lazier making my own) <br>
      I continued with my other work for a bit then headed back home. <br>
      All in all, a very average day. <br>
      Clock in and clock out, transactional style. <br>
      Is this what university life should be? <br>
      Or am I missing something the "university aesthetic girlies" can see… <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 25: Triple Tapping </h1>
    <p>
      What a day. I’m still down with a sickness. <br>
      Probably a flu or a cold or some bug I bet. <br>
      Whatever, university is like the ultimate breeding ground for viruses. <br>
      I went in to do some prep for my next algorithms assignment. <br>
      I know I literally handed it in a few days ago but I’m always on that sigma grindset. <br>
      By that I mean avoiding my home issues staying at the university or library. <br>
      I like running away from my problems if you couldn’t tell. <br>
      Then we had another student voice meeting. I was the only person in my year to attend which is interesting but whatever. <br>
      It overran which was awkward because I literally had a meeting about placements right after. <br>
      The guy doing them (administrative side) is very chill and relaxed. <br>
      He made me feel very at ease which is even more nice considering he’s only been at the university for a couple months. <br>
      Our cohort is like the first generation in his domain. <br>
      And I ain’t talking about domain expansions either. <br>
      There was some random workshop I got invited to, but someone else was teaching in that class. <br>
      I didn’t go in, just awkwardly looked through the glass. <br>
      I am an introvert, what did you expect?! <br>
      And then I had my actual lecture. I got some free stuff and learnt some stuff too. <br>
      Duh. I felt like ass but I least I showed up. <br>
      A dumb cold won’t stop the legend (that's me!) ✨ <br>
