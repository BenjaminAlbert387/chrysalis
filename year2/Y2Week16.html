    <h1> Day 24: Flame On (11th November 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Well this week my train wasn’t actually late Monday morning so that’s automatically a good thing. 
      Class was fine until the fire alarm went off. Wasn’t even a test one or anything. 
      It legit just went and happened. 
      At least I handed in my first assignment of this academic year! Only loads more to go…
      Got some lunch at the library 
      (I was too lazy going into town and I’m even lazier making my own) 
      I continued with my other work for a bit then headed back home. 
      All in all, a very average day. 
      Clock in and clock out, transactional style. 
      Is this what university life should be? 
      Or am I missing something the "university aesthetic girlies" can see…

    <h1> Day 25: Triple Tapping </h1>
    <p>
      What a day. I’m still down with a sickness. 
      Probably a flu or a cold or some bug I bet. 
      Whatever, university is like the ultimate breeding ground for viruses.
      I went in to do some prep for my next algorithms assignment. 
      I know I literally handed it in a few days ago but I’m always on that sigma grindset. 
      By that I mean avoiding my home issues staying at the university or library. 
      I like running away from my problems if you couldn’t tell. 
      Then we had another student voice meeting. I was the only person in my year to attend which is interesting but whatever. 
      It overran which was awkward because I literally had a meeting about placements right after.
      The guy doing them (administrative side) is very chill and relaxed. 
      He made me feel very at ease which is even more nice considering he’s only been at the university for a couple months. 
      Our cohort is like the first generation in his domain. 
      And I ain’t talking about domain expansions either.
      There was some random workshop I got invited to, but someone else was teaching in that class. 
      I didn’t go in, just awkwardly looked through the glass. 
      I am an introvert, what did you expect?!
      And then I had my actual lecture. I got some free stuff and learnt some stuff too. 
      Duh. I felt like ass but I least I showed up. 
      A dumb cold won’t stop the legend (that's me!) ✨
