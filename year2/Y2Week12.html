    <h1> Day 9: Multi Dimensional Major (16th October 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      I did a crap ton today. Seriously. <br>
      Firstly continued with the admin side of the Clearing Peak team. <br>
      Fun I know, but it’s easy work and I get paid for it. <br>
      We’re not taking new applications, so what we have is what we’re gonna have for the year. <br>
      Pretty exciting and I’m glad they saw potential in me when I didn’t. <br>
      Then I had my first course rep meeting. Yes I technically skipped class but it seems it worked out. <br>
      Apparently the lecturers were having a bit of a moan and then a bit of a pep talk? <br>
      Glad I wasn’t involved. But the university definitely seems like they want to make everything more inclusive and welcoming. <br>
      We shall see if they’re successful or just a pipe dream. <br>
      I did catch up with my actual lecture and had McDonald’s, then did some tech support work and got involved with my other job. <br>
      It’s pretty chill, though I definitely have to get involved more. <br>
      No keeping cameras off and mics muted! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 10: Breaking and Making </h1>
    <p>
      Got in nice and early to lock in on some university work. <br>
      I think I’m okay with it all. It’s just expanding on knowledge done last year. <br>
      Then had a session online with some networking thing. It was a bit long but quite useful to know about. <br>
      And it boosted my LinkedIn profile. <br>
      Finally ended the day with my actual lecture and already numbers are dropping. <br>
      I guess the threat of attendance hunting you down didn’t seem to work. <br>
      In Pokémon terms, it wasn’t very effective… <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 11: Logging and Drinking </h1>
    <p>
      We actually have an assignment now. <br>
      I’m gonna have to lock in hard to do well on it, but we have all the details and some helpful tips. <br>
      Even though I’m course rep, I still actually need to do my training so I’m actually an official one. <br>
      I just hope I can do a good job. <br>
      As it was the last day of my job (No I didn’t get fired, it was a temporary job) we decided to have a little celebration. <br>
      I didn’t have too much in the afternoon since I did have another lecture to attend and I didn’t want to feel like crap. <br>
      I’m gonna miss working with them to be honest. ;-; <br>
      The networking lab we did was pretty self explanatory. I like helping my classmates as it shows I understand what I’m actually doing. <br>
      Plus we do have an exam for it soon. <br>
      Some of the other members of staff don’t personally agree with it but it’s his module. <br>
      He’s calling the shots. <br>
      *Future me here. He actually wasn't, he had to step in last minute. That takes some serious respect to be honest. <br>
      After that, I had a meal and some drinks with my coworkers. <br>
      I was a bit nervous socialising with people I didn’t personally know. <br>
      It’s like an introvert and socially awkward guy's nightmare?! <br>
      But I’m glad I said yes and did it. <br>
