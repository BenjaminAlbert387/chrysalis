    <h1> Day 28: Grinding (18th November 2024)  </h1>

    <h1> Day 29: Public Transport Problems </h1>
    <p>
      My god the universe really didn’t want me getting into class today. <br>
      I got stuck at a midway train station for almost two hours because every single consecutive train got cancelled. <br>
      Not even because of a fatality, some dumb electrical fault. <br>
      Had to get a replacement bus to university and not gonna lie I almost got sick. <br>
      The person stood next to me stunk of cigarettes and combined with a crowded bus…not a wombo combo. <br>
      Tragic start to the day but I got my PowerPoint presentation almost done. <br>
      Gotta find a way to cut down on the words a bit. <br>
      Eventually got into the library and one of my mates was there, he’s nice. <br>
      Helped my other friend too which is always a positive. <br>
      Then we walked together to class. <br>
      Which (because of the trains) had much less people than usual. <br>
      Sucks to be them because it was very useful information. <br>
      Lot to take in but we’re second year students for a reason. <br>
      After that I got some food and then did my actual job. <br>
      I’m still employed somehow? <br>
      (Not really suprising, it’s called a contract) <br>
      I did my good deed of the day by handing in some lost headphones into security. <br>
      Also because stealing is bad and I’m not getting into trouble. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 30: A (Study) Room with A View </h1>
    <p>
      Well, at least I actually made it to university on a functioning train. <br>
      Apparently the motorway is cooked so anyone driving is gonna be having the time of their lives. <br>
      Explains why most of our class wasn’t here today…oh wait spoiler alert! <br>
      Before that though I was just continuing with assignments. <br>
      Then I did some volunteering fun, this time it was a pilot scheme about how the library study rooms were being used. <br>
      I felt kinda inadequate since I’ve literally only used them once but I gave some ideas which is good. <br>
      And it inspired me somewhat for my project. <br>
      It feels nice helping others when I can’t help myself… <br>
      Class was just normal but I actually know some more people’s names now (They joined the group’s discord server). <br>
      I can remember the Pokédex and every Pokémon but can’t remember the people in my own class. <br>
      Even worse when they know my name and I don't know theirs. Kinda embarasssing. <br>
      My brain works in mysterious ways huh. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 31: Getting Railed. Hard. </h1>
    <p>
      You know how there’s stories of people sleeping in and missing the flight that would’ve been 9/11? <br>
      Felt kinda like that today. <br>
      Because my bed was too cozy and I would’ve had to wait in the freezing cold because the normal day time train got cancelled. <br>
      Did some more revision with the help of AI. <br>
      If you know what you’re prompting you can essentially generate mock tests AND you won’t get tempted by the answer sheet. <br>
      The lab session was relatively chill, I participated a lot more than usual because there really wasn’t many people there today. <br>
