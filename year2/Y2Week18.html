    <h1> Day 32: Rise (25th November 2024)  </h1>
    <p>
      Work in progress...
    </p>

    <h1> Day 33: Extra Special Edition </h1>
    <p>
      Another trip? You bet I’m coming. <br>
      It was pretty good and learnt a lot about placement years. <br>
      Also we did an AI jailbreaking activity and got free lunch so that was fun. <br>
      After that I went into class for a little bit and then went out of class for more course rep shenanigans. <br>
      It was a yap fest. I could’ve joined online but in person is better I feel like? <br>
      Shows commitment and dedication. <br>
      Ironically our topic this week was project management and risks. <br>
      Skipping half our class is a risk but I can mitigate it by watching the recording. <br>
      Low risk and medium impact. See, aren’t I good? <br>
      After that I got some McDonald’s and revised at the library. <br>
      Not before seeing some snow angel lady in a white dress use a fake snow machine. <br>
      Not really feeling festive right now because it’s not even December. <br>
      Kinda woke if you’re doing it this early to be honest. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 34: Crashing Out, I Am </h1>
    <p>
      I did some revision in the morning…or did I? <br>
      Yeah I did, at least that’s what I thought. <br>
      I generate questions then answer them, then get ChatGPT to rate my answers. <br>
      Symbiotic relationship innit. <br>
      I got some lunch at the library (I apparently go there so often now they recognise me and ask if I want “the usual”) <br>
      This cute girl sat directly opposite me. Why she didn’t go to the multiple other free tables, I honestly don’t know... <br>
      But she had her headphones in so automatically I’m thinking she’s shy. <br>
      I also saw one of the StressLess volunteers I’ve worked with previously. <br>
      I’m glad she’s doing well. :) <br>
      Today’s lesson was…interesting. <br>
      The exam I’ve been revising for two weeks straight has been completed restructured and I’ve essentially wasted all that time. <br>
      And the exam is TOMORROW! Pissed off is an understatement. <br>
      The university is straight up molly coddling students, but I know it’s gonna bite them in the ass hard. <br>
      Ironically enough, most people didn’t even attend today’s class. <br>
      You’d think it being the last class before the exam you’d want to turn up. <br>
      I went with my mate to do some last minute revision at the library but to be honest it was clear we both lost motivation. <br>
      Which is scary, because if I lose motivation I can spiral very quickly. <br>
      I felt pretty confident before. <br>
      I could actually apply what I learnt in context but now? <br>
      It doesn’t even matter most people are going to do pretty good on it. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 35: Exam Time! </h1>
    <p>
      Well that just happened. The exam was difficult but not in the way you’d expect. <br>
      We got limited to answering four extended questions with just 600 words. <br>
      It’s a lot more difficult than it sounds because there’s always a fear of “not explaining yourself” in enough detail. <br>
      But at the same time, going over your word count and lecturers are legitimately allowed to stop reading your work. <br>
      It’s a tough balance. The questions were pretty easy though considering they had to nerf the difficulty. <br>
      Our class is genuinely a bunch of crybabies complaining that the mock was “too hard”. <br>
      Do they think life is just all nice and easy? Whatever. <br>
      I also bought some Lego and got some Burger King with my friends in the afternoon. <br> 
      In the morning I revised for a little bit before the exam and headed off. <br>
