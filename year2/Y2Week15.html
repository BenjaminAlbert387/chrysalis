    <h1> Day 21: Matter of Time (4th November 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Well that was tragic. My train got cancelled and my next train got delayed. 
      So I was waiting at the station for over an hour in the cold ;-;
      Didn’t even manage to get my Greggs breakfast because I was quite late to class at this point. 
      I emailed the lecturer because that’s just common courtesy innit. 
      I then got some lunch at the library cafe (didn’t fancy anything else) and continued to work on my assignment. 
      Then had a meeting with one of the writing team about my other assignment (The one due in two weeks!). 
      She actually said my first draft was very clear and overall a good piece of work. 
      I just have to restructure some of the paragraphs, add a reference and link it a bit more. 
      Then the library sensors started beeping at me which startled the crap out of me. 
      It’s because it detected a library book (Even though I bought it off eBay). 
      Strangely it’s never gone off before with my notebooks. 
      I got it desensitised and then ran to the train station. 
      I barely got on with moments to spare… which was exciting and got my cardio up.
    </p>

    <h1> Day 22: R Is For…  </h1>
    <p>
      Didn’t do too much exciting stuff today. 
      I mean it’s assessment season so people are just trying to survive right now. 
      Literally, today is the day Trump won the election. 
      I mean I’m not in America but he’s quite relevant considering trade deals and economy. 
      Anyways I continue with assignments then have my class. 
      We’re using data analytics software and it’s not even considered a programming language. 
      It’s even easier than Python. And it can make pretty graphs and charts. 
      After some McDonald’s and meeting up with the squad I do some uni work and then actual work. 
      Still got a job ✨
    </p>

    <h1> Day 23: The Academic Comeback </h1>
    <p>
      The library may as well be my new spawn point. 
      I’m there so much now it’s kinda insane. 
      But I mean, I kinda am paying for it via tuition fees. 
      I was there for a couple hours doing my assessment. 
      Then my uni friends showed up so I joined them for a bit. 
      I have an assignment due in a few days so I’m just proofreading it. 
      I think it’s good enough, I have a better format and structure compared to last year. 
      Then I got some lunch and by that I mean try something new. 
      It was a vegan baguette and…I’m not having it ever again it tastes so bad. 
      Had to get a Twix bar so I wouldn’t crash out.
      Lesson went fine, we had a discussion about life, internships and the job market. 
      Pretty useful stuff, though at this point many people had left. Sucks to be them.
