    <h1>  Extra Stage 3: Panels and Presentations </h1>
    <p>
      Wake up in the morning feeling like â€¦ normal. <br>
      I get a cheeky Greggs sausage roll then head onto campus. <br>
      Iâ€™m only here because there was a job interview. Fancy. <br>
      The first part was group work with some people Iâ€™ve never seen before, then a presentation. <br>
      It was kinda stressful but I got over it. At least I know some people who might be on the team. <br>
      (4 people who applied didnâ€™t show up which was really bad ðŸ’€) <br>
      Then the second part was an actual typical panel interview. <br>
      I prepared some questions and stuff which is always good. <br>
      Well, hereâ€™s to hoping! âœ¨ <br>
      (Future me here, yep I did get the job. Now I'm helping the university. Pretty cool, huh.) <br>
