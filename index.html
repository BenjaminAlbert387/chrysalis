    <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
    <p>I'm Benjamin. Yes, a guy wrote all this. I think conforming to "societal standards" is sooo stupid and is probably why toxic masculinity is on the rise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If I'm not doing assignments or journaling, I'm either gaming, watching or touching grass. Not into clubbing or anything like that, and I sure as hell don't want sex.</p>
