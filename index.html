    <h1>This is a diary of my life as a univerity student. Filled with hope, despair, dreams and more!</h1>

    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>I'm Benjamin. Yes, a guy wrote all this, not a girl. I think conforming to "societal standards" is sooo stupid, and is probably why toxic masculinity is on the rise.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If I'm not doing assignments or journaling, I'm either gaming, watching or touching grass. Not into clubbing or anything like that, and I sure as hell don't want sex.</p>
    <p>Garlic bread, cake and dragons for me please.</p>
