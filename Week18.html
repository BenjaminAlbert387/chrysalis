    <h1> Day 42: Speed Runner, Money Master (27th November 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      So I totally didnâ€™t wake up at 7:50am and speed ran my morning routine. <br>
      Gets the blood pumping right? <br>
      Well at least I saw someone I know on my way to university <br>
      While I was still tired, hungry and cold. Fun. <br>
      Nothing interesting happened in my lectures apart from the fact that we finished 45 minutes early for our afternoon one. <br>
      Next week is our group debate which can only go two ways: amazing or awful. <br>
      Then I did some more ambassador training. <br> 
      It was for a board game (like Monopoly) but university themed. <br>
      It was alright actually. <br>
      Then I got the train home with two friends. <br>
      I saved them from the cat ears... this time. ðŸ˜ˆ <br>
      But I donâ€™t save them from my random waffling. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 43: Hello, I Like Money </h1>
    <p>
      Today was chill. <br>
      The morning workshop was a bit challenging. <br>
      But thatâ€™s good, we like a challenge. <br>
      Thinking about it like Minecraft made it much easier. <br>
      I guess video games are helpful after all. Parents ainâ€™t always right. ðŸŽµ <br>
      Then I had McDonaldâ€™s with my friend. I got the 99p McChicken and he got some McPlant deal. <br>
      I definitely won out of us two. <br>
      Then ambassador training. The ones I do are session specific so regular ambassadors donâ€™t have to do them. <br>
      Anyways today was a creative journey essentially about a random student we got. <br>
      It was alright, but hey Iâ€™m getting paid to do it. <br>
      I also got my ambassador hoodie, there werenâ€™t any shirts my size. <br>
      Kinda drippy, not gonna lie. <br>
      Then I came into my afternoon lecture fashionably late. <br>
      Donâ€™t worry. I did tell my lecturer beforehand. <br>
      Common courtesy goes a long way in university. <br>
      She even suggested to have a break and get something to eat before I go in. <br>
      I think she knows because Iâ€™ll show up anyways. <br>
      Unlike most of my class who will dip out. <br>
      I just gotta do my timesheets... and my cosplay?! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 44: Help Me, Help You </h1>
    <p>
      Pretty chill day. Literally. <br>
      Itâ€™s cold and I donâ€™t like the cold. <br>
      How can some people prefer winter over summer? <br>
      Iâ€™m not biased because my birthday is in summer or anything. <br>
      But you can do way more and thereâ€™s no risks of colds or flu. <br>
      Anyways I was just getting on with my work in the morning as usual. <br> 
      Then I go to my lecture and itâ€™s pretty dry. <br>
      Iâ€™m not surprised most people donâ€™t show up for it. <br>
      Next week might be even less because of the train strike. <br> 
      But I might have a solution for that since thereâ€™s an event I want to attend. <br>
      We shall have to see. <br>
      (Spoiler warning - there wasn't a solution) <br>
      Then I got some more McDonaldâ€™s. 99p nuggets! <br>
      And helped my friend with his CV and getting him a sausage roll. <br>
      At least I got some free crisps from it. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 45: I Used Payday, Itâ€™s Super Effective!  </h1>
    <p>
      I almost finished another assignment. <br>
      I was pretty much doing that this morning as well as being a bit sad. <br>
      My headphones ran out of juice mid song. <br>
      Had to bust out my wired ones like a basketball team picking a reserve player. <br>
      Then I bought McDonaldâ€™s and a Hot Wheels car. Itâ€™s really cool. Trust me. <br>
      I just realised Iâ€™ve had nothing but McDonaldâ€™s the entire week. <br>
      Oh well, I exercise enough and my other two meals of the day are healthy. <br>
      I also tried to see if CEX had a game I wanted but alas nothing. <br>
      I met up with the uni squad and just relaxed for a bit. <br>
      Then I got an email from the university about free money. <br>
      Itâ€™s the reward from being a Partner School ambassador. <br>
      And I got paid too so tonight will be fun. <br>
      And by that I mean...buying vbucks? <br>
      Then more coding. I already finished my coding project. <br>
      So I was just attempting to code a slot machine game. <br>
      It kinda works? Considering I only spent two hours on it, not bad. <br>
