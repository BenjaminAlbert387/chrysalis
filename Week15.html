    <h1> Day 30: Group Project? Yay. (6th November 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      So yay group project time. <br>
      I got blessed by the RNG gods. <br>
      I got some extroverts on my squad because I might‚Äôve cried. <br>
      Dw, I got self nominated to be co leader. <br>
      So I basically do the formatting of the document. <br>
      And speaking it too woop woop (I need the big XP gains from it) <br>
      Everything else was pretty dry, I had to prove my right to work to...work. <br>
      And tonight I have to do the ambassador training for real as well as fill out some forms. <br>
      Welcome to despair, Benjamin. <br>
      I didn‚Äôt know this at the time but someone in my group was also at the train station. <br>
      I didn‚Äôt notice because I am pretty bad at face recognition but she awkwardly noticed me. <br>
      Anyways, we sat together on the train and talked for a while... <br>
      I‚Äôm impressed in myself. <br>
      Her travel time is like, almost 2 hours each way. <br>
      But she‚Äôs nice. <br>
      For some reason I‚Äôm more comfortable in talking to introverted women than men. <br>
      Maybe it‚Äôs because I have to force myself to talk more. <br>
      Whatever. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 31: A ‚ÄúU‚Äù In Group Work </h1>
    <p>
      Today was pretty uneventful. <br>
      We‚Äôre just going through content at the moment. <br>
      But I have completed my online training for the partner school ambassador job. <br>
      Now just have to deal with the in person one tomorrow. <br>
      At least it‚Äôs paid. <br>
      The group session I planned only had one other person join. <br>
      Maybe I‚Äôm very naive in people attending but come on. <br>
      How else do I motivate my group? Am I supposed to choose violence? <br>
      Bribery? Threats of snitching? <br>
      Whatever, I sorted out the actual structure of the speech. <br>
      Now it‚Äôs just the actual speech itself we gotta work on. <br>
      Starting to hate people again I can‚Äôt lie. <br>
      That‚Äôs all! ü•∂ <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 32: Storming Through </h1>
    <p>
      Went to the library and started on my second assignment. <br>
      I wanna complete it as soon as possible because it‚Äôs so dry. <br>
      And yeah, out of sight out of my mind. <br>
      Then I went to my lecture and holy hell it‚Äôs dead. <br>
      For a class of 120 students probably 30 showed up. <br>
      Whatever. We did sorting methods. <br>
      I got involved a lot standing in front and doing the sorting shenanigans. <br> 
      Because a) It‚Äôs piss easy. <br>
      And b) I‚Äôm at the front I‚Äôm gonna get picked. <br>
      So may as well do it on my own accord. <br>
      Also may as well be known to the lecturers? <br> 
      They‚Äôre the ones giving a reference sooo yeah. <br>
      Then I got McDonald‚Äôs and did my ambassador training. <br>
      I get paid at the end of the month. <br>
      Pretty self explanatory information, I think I want to work in the outreach department. <br> 
      Since that‚Äôs like helping with personal statements and general talks about my journey to university. <br>
      Which is different than usual because of my gap year but different is good. <br>
      I think. Tomorrow is gonna be busy but I think I‚Äôll survive. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 33: Quadruple Damage </h1>
    <p>
      My day starts like every other Thursday, just even colder. <br>
      I hate winter so much. Whatever. <br>
      I get in, continue with my assignments. <br>
      I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs about 50% done. Not bad at all. <br>
      Then I do more Outlook training. <br>
      I‚Äôve attended both workshops necessary so now I just have to pass some mock tests consecutively. <br>
      I should be good for the real thing. <br>
      Then I get Greggs and come back because there‚Äôs an online seminar. <br>
      I‚Äôll write about it on my LinkedIn because idk proactive is good innit. <br> 
      Though I had to finish it early because I had another workshop about Green Careers. <br>
      Proper fancy but because it started at 3pm I had to leave half way through. <br>
      So I wouldn‚Äôt be late to my actual class. <br>
      Then coding woo I love coding. <br>
      My code almost works, it‚Äôs so annoying. <br>
      Just one or two little parts don‚Äôt function as intended but like at worst I‚Äôm only losing 13 marks out of 100. <br>
      (You need at least 40 marks for 5/6 assignments) <br>
      And I got 100% on my first assignment so like I‚Äôm not gonna tear out my hair for it. <br>
