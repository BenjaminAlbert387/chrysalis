    <h1> Day 50: End of Ethics and Employability </h1>
    <p>
      Today was my final lesson of the ethics module and it will not be missed. <br>
      I mean to be honest it’s not exactly the most thrilling subject anyway. <br>
      Like it’s naturally dry. But the lecturer was nice. <br>
      I did get to lead a group which is something I’ve never done before. <br>
      The second assignment is literally 99% done. <br>
      I just have to add the finishing touches on it and bang out a good grade. <br>
      I’ll be legit saddened if I don’t get more than 80% because I busted by ass for it. <br>
      I know it doesn’t matter for your actual degree but I’m a percentage slut. <br>
      I like seeing big numbers and nice comments on my work. <br>
      I believe the proper term is positive reinforcement or a positive feedback loop. <br>
      I dripped myself out with the festive cat ears. <br>
      Mixed opinions, two people liked it, two people didn't. <br>
      Can’t please everyone these days. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 51: Decoded Despair </h1>
    <p>
      Well I got up late because I silenced both of my alarms. <br>
      I guess I’ll need three now. <br>
      But my lesson doesn’t start until 10am anyway which was fine. <br>
      They had to combine all three groups together because there were like 10 people in each group. <br>
      And our class size is 120. We were just continuing to use the micro bits. <br> 
      We got told what our assignment 2 was. I’ll start working on it tonight. <br>
      Then I had Greggs and had some online training. <br>
      (Which is now pointless because I just got texted about some family commitments on the same day the event was.) <br>
      Ffs. <br>
      I’m also cold and wet and today has just sucked major ass all around. <br>
      Woke up late, now got another assignment to do and can’t even do this event I wanted to attend. <br>
      It’s like a triple threat to my mental health. Actually there’s a forth thing, but it doesn’t concern ya. <br>
      Well, tomorrow can’t come soon enough right? <br>
      Unless a meteor hits earth containing parasites and aliens. <br>
      It could not get any worse. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 52: Computational Thinking Completed </h1>
    <p>
      Today was alright. <br>
      I spent most of it doing some work while listening to a podcast. <br>
      But not those weird right wing ones where it’s like: <br> 
      “Women are just baby makers and white men rule the world” <br>
      Like actually funny ones. Not the point. <br>
      I was also helping someone with her code, and by that I mean running it on my laptop. <br> 
      Because her Chromebook (yes, they still exist) can’t run Visual Studio. <br>
      I also had to help her submit the right file because she was low-key stressing about it. <br>
      My friend also rang me about birthday traditions, I just told him to buy drinks for the birthday guy rather than worrying about presents. <br>
      It’s crazy to think that we met and became friends only because he went into the wrong class 4 weeks into the first semester. <br>
      The lecture itself was so so dry. I could genuinely count the amount of people that turned up on two hands. <br>
      But I like showing my face since yknow we are paying for it. <br>
      That’s assuming I don’t bag a baddie who’s rich. <br>
      Tomorrow is the final day of the first semester. <br>
      Finally! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 53: The Holiday Special  </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing was particularly special about today really. <br>
      I mean I did some photoshoots in the morning because I wanted to. <br>
      They even made me sign a release form so I couldn’t sue the university for using my beautiful face. <br>
      I say that, but they’re definitely gonna need photoshop. <br>
      Since I got a mini spot on my cheek. It’s actually surprising how fast they do the shoots. <br>
      I thought there’s like a long set up, wait time but no it is rapid. <br>
      I might recreate the “pointing” meme if I see myself on a poster. <br>
      Don’t worry, I didn’t wear my cat ears during them. <br>
      After that I got some McDonald’s and did the monthly StressLess event. <br>
      Loads of people turned up which was good but... <br>
      I think they were more interested in the free drinks and biscuits. <br>
      I did create some stuff which is nice. <br>
      “Creativity is the best skill a programmer has” or whatever my lecturer says. <br>
      Take that art students, you’re not the only ones who get to be creative! 😤 <br>
      Then the last workshop of the semester, I was just doing a part of my assignment to be honest. <br>
      Even less people managed to turn up but that could be because people keep getting infected and drop like flies. <br>
      Or they’ve gone back home already. <br>
      University is definitely a step up but I think I did alright all things considered. <br>
      I have some friends, went out a few times and there were more good days than bad ones. <br>
      So yeah! <br>
      I am nowhere near getting a girl at university though. <br>
      But do I actually want one? <br>
