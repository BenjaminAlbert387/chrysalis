    <h1> Day 63: But That‚Äôs Just A Theory. A Graph Theory. (20th February 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      I didn‚Äôt really do that much in the morning um... <br>
      Just finishing off some stuff. <br>
      I was supposed to help someone with his maths but I think he was busy. <br>
      Oh well. Afternoon was fine, Maths lecture I had to force myself to lock in and not drift off. <br>
      I sat with my friend for pretty much the entire of today. <br>
      While my other friends kept rocking up to class like 10 minutes late. <br> 
      I don‚Äôt blame them tbh. Programming lecture was whatever. <br>
      Mainly just group stuff and how to work as a team ‚ú® <br>
      It would help if I actually got in contact with the other half of the group but... <br>
      I have better chances of finding a woman on my bed. <br>
      The maths practical was fine, we learnt graph theory today so I actually had a challenge. 
      I say we, others already knew what to do. <br>
      The curriculum in other countries is much more maths oriented than here where we do‚Ä¶a bit of everything. <br>
      But it was alright. <br>
      I also added someone from my uni friend group to my Pok√©mon GO friends list. <br>
      He does Business IT so I barely see him around. <br>
      Bit sad as he‚Äôs quite mature and keeps the rest of the group in line. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 64: I Don‚Äôt Remember Asking </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing interesting happens in the morning let‚Äôs be real. <br>
      Actually, the lecturer had to suddenly leave coz he got a call. <br>
      From the head of university. Damn. <br>
      We‚Äôre just learning about ‚Äúmemory allocation‚Äù which is probably just a bunch of words to ya. <br>
      Normally I‚Äôd go to Greggs but because it was yeeting it down I decided not to get wet and moist ;) <br>
      By staying inside and just going into the cafe on one of the buildings with my friends. Someone else also joined which was a surprise. <br>
      I was attempting to code but I didn‚Äôt get very far‚Ä¶ I just got frustrated. <br>
      But I did learn some things which might help later. <br>
      Like the Mouseketool. (If you don‚Äôt know what that is you‚Äôre uncultured.) <br>
      I had a meeting for another ambassador thing. <br>
      I just did because I got emailed about it (Don‚Äôt remember applying) <br>
      And the ambassador roles stack I think? <br>
      Not like it really matters, because the SCE Ambassador role usually takes place during school hours. <br>
      And I‚Äôd rather be learning content for my coursework than screwing around. <br>
      So technically I‚Äôm now SCE and Subject Ambassador. <br>
      No, that doesn‚Äôt mean I can put that as two job titles (sadly). <br>
      It does mean I have two different sections for that role. <br>
      The afternoon session was fine, just actually put the memory shenanigans to use. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 65: Hold Up, Let Him Code  </h1>
    <p>
      This morning actually had something interesting! <br>
      Just kidding. Unless you find coursework interesting and me texting my friends about life, death and video games. <br>
      Afternoon actually had some interesting things. <br>
      I got a McSpicy for ¬£1 and then headed into campus. <br>
      There was some Academic Support event and to be honest I don‚Äôt think it was intended for me. <br>
      But I still went anyway because they gave out free sweets and another tote bag. <br>
      Then I just went to somewhere quiet to focus and listen to my amazing mixtape. üî• <br>
      I mean playlist. <br>
      Then evening practical, I actually met one of my group members who I hadn‚Äôt seen before. <br>
      He‚Äôs uh‚Ä¶mysterious. Doesn‚Äôt talk much and definitely doesn‚Äôt want to be buddy buddy either. <br>
      Whatever. I caught him up to speed, then he went. <br>
      I got my other group members doing tasks and I was coding the basic logic. <br>
      I almost got it working too, but I still need to work on it a bit more. <br>
      Luckily my class is actually really nice to me so I ask some people about how to do X thing and they help. üôÇ <br>
      And I also got jumpscared multiple times coz people were interested in my code :P. <br>
      Just sucks that next year I‚Äôm not gonna see as many people because of the different courses. <br>
      But I hope we still message and talk. üòä <br>
      And I guess I can make some new friends too. <br>
