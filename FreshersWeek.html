    <h1>Day 1: The Worst (And Best) First Day At University‚Ä¶ </h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to the little shit (aka my brother) who took too long doing his hair as well as a tragic car crash next to the train station‚Ä¶I missed the train. 
      So I arrived at university kinda pissed off and kinda sweaty. 
      Then I actually had to go into my introductory lecture half an hour late. (I call it fashionably late but I don‚Äôt think anyone else in that hall did.) 
      Way to make a first impression‚Ä¶At least I sat at the front? Only because I didn‚Äôt see any other seats close to me. 
      And surprisingly the computing cohort is like a 70 / 30 split for guys and girls. But we‚Äôll get our actual groups tomorrow.
      After that I went for a walk around the campus. 
      As in literally looped around twice because I didn‚Äôt know I could go through the specific gates‚Ä¶I thought they were just for lorries and cars. 
      But yes you can go through them. Least I know now.
      
      After I did the welcome fair and got told about a crap ton of information I saw this ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù and thought I should tag along. No harm right? Except when this girl asked me: 
      <pre>
      ‚ÄúWhat do I play?‚Äù 
      I was like ‚ÄúLike video game consoles?‚Äù
      ‚ÄúNo Benjamin‚Ä¶what instrument do you play?‚Äù
      </pre>
      And that point I knew I didn‚Äôt join a casual friend group going around together ‚Ä¶ I joined a music group. 
      Miraculously, someone knew me and so I went with him after I explained to their music professor what the fuck a Computer Science student is doing with the musically inclined.
      We got lunch and drinks at Wetherspoons, I listened to my newfound group try out new guitars (they‚Äôre really good!) and yeah that‚Äôs kinda how it went down. 
      I met some new people and made some new friends in the weirdest way possible. üòå
    </p>

    <h1>Day 2: Second Chances</h1>
    <p>
      I actually managed to get on the train this time. 
      Go me. 
      I got there pretty early because I wanted to do a bit of exploring. 
      Like Dora the Explorer just yknow way smexier. 
      I managed to find a park nearby that was pretty quiet and peaceful and tons of shortcuts to the university. 
      I think I‚Äôll just stick to one route which consists of like two right turns and the rest are straightaways.
      After my amazing McDonald‚Äôs I went back to do some calligraphy. 
      It‚Äôs like a fancy form of handwriting where you gotta stroke it correctly. Wink.
      I also met someone. She seemed alright. 
      It‚Äôs also in the student union building which looks new, has a claw machine and a cafeteria. 
      But I had to end the session early because of my lecture. 
      It‚Äôs fucking annoying how half the events I can‚Äôt even attend because of my course (tragic I know) but eh opportunity cost innit.
      Also I didn‚Äôt know this but if a lecture starts at 2pm‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt just rock up at 2pm. 
      Once again I was the last one in. 
      I thought it‚Äôs like school but I guess not, gotta be early for some reason? 
      Maybe it‚Äôs the fresher week thing and afterwards people start not giving a shit. 
      I also made friends with someone who actually does Computer Science. 
      And I think someone on my train was also in my class, but they looked busy and I didn‚Äôt exactly want to disturb 'em.
    </p>

    <h1> Day 3: Fresher's Fair Fun</h1>
    <p>
      Wandered around for a bit and actually turned up somewhat early. 
      I think 10 mins early for a lecture is good enough.
      I like standing up for a bit before my ass is seated for multiple hours. 
      Now I know who was on my train. 
      Did I even attempt to have a conversation with them? 
      Ofc not I‚Äôm an introverted little bitch too scared to do anything except sit behind‚Ä¶but they're pretty cool. 
      Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll work up some courage or something. (Future Benjamin here - I didn't)
      After that was Fresher's Fair. 
      It was so fuckin crowded and sweaty and noisy so not fun but I got a ton of free loot and a ton of incoming spam. 
      I managed to get a few phone numbers of people so who knows? 
      Then after Burger King I went back for this Cafe Social event.
      Which isn‚Äôt in a cafe and wasn‚Äôt even social because NO ONE EXCEPT ME turned up. 
      Kinda awkward. 
      Anyway the lady running the thing showed me around the actual art / music / graphic design building which was nice of her. 
      And I even did some kitchen litho artwork. 
      Came out scuffed as hell but it worked for a first attempt which was fortunate. 
      I then met some of the board game people up top and they got quite a collection.
      Then home time, I did what I needed to do and extra and tbh I‚Äôm too drained for anything else for today‚Ä¶
    </p>

    <h1>Day 4: What's A PAT?</h1>
    <p>
      Who doesn‚Äôt love a wander around first thing in the morning. 
      Apart from crippled people. Whatever I found more parks and more cafes around. Maybe if I‚Äôm feeling fancy I‚Äôll check them out. 
      Seems like no one set their alarms today since the class was pretty dead. Like less than a third capacity. 
      Oh well, we aren‚Äôt exactly learning content... but it‚Äôs good to build a consistent routine when you haven‚Äôt done that for the past year.
      I gotta start getting some people who actually turn up because group work innit. 
      But luckily all computer based courses do the same thing for the first year so everyone gets to know each other. 
      Eventually‚Ä¶Woot. I had a lovely Tesco meal deal. At least pasta and chicken is kinda healthy? Better than the fast food I‚Äôve had so far.
      Then we met our personal academic tutor (PAT). By we I mean 5 of us. Out of like 17 people who were supposed to be there. 
      He‚Äôs pretty chill and funny. And let us go 40 mins early.
      Then I speed walked to the station from campus and did it in like 12 minutes. It usually takes 15 depending on waiting for crossing lights, traffic etc. 
      Don‚Äôt think my classmate did though coz he also takes the train. Tragic.
      No events today because I had lectures during them. Kinda annoying because there was live music and lots of paint and powder all over campus.
  </p>

    <h1>Day 5: Snitches and Switches</h1>
    <p>
      So yknow how I was like late to my two lectures and learnt ‚Äúoh I should probably come in earlier‚Äù. 
      Turns out I should also peep inside first because I definitely didn‚Äôt waltz right into an introduction for psychology not computing. 
      Least the students got a laugh so that‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶
      Before you say anything; I was in the RIGHT room, but WRONG time. I can follow a timetable.
      I had McDonald‚Äôs afterwards, idc I walk enough steps to burn off the calories. 
      Plus I‚Äôm still finding cafes and whatever so for now it‚Äôs fast yummy food.
      Then after lunch I went to the fancy library building and‚Ä¶our lecturer straight up didn‚Äôt show up. 
      We (the quarter of the class) all checked our outlook emails, notifications and nothing. So that was very awkward.
      But I wasn‚Äôt leaving on a low note so I went upstairs and there‚Äôs a StressLess session. 
      Luckily this one had actual people in it, except they were all ladies and were doing their nails? 
      I think. Didn‚Äôt really see nor care. They had a Nintendo Wii though which was nice.
      I even got complimented on my amazing Just Dance skills.
      I think the girls were laughing too. 
      Like in a ‚Äúaww he‚Äôs adorable‚Äù way not ‚Äúhaha fucking loser‚Äù I hope. 
      I then told the staff about the computing lecture that never was and the fact we didn‚Äôt get told anything.
      Turns out she can contact all the higher ups so uh sorry for that person coz she seemed more pissed off than me. 
      The train back was awkward since it was delayed due to electrical problems somewhere else but oh well. 
      Least I can rest properly now and prepare for next week when it actually start for realsies.
