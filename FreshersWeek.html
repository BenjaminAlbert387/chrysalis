    <h1>Day 1: The Worst (And Best) First Day At University… </h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to the little shit (aka my brother) who took too long doing his hair as well as a tragic car crash next to the train station…I missed the train. 
      So I arrived at university kinda pissed off and kinda sweaty. 
      Then I actually had to go into my introductory lecture half an hour late. (I call it fashionably late but I don’t think anyone else in that hall did.) 
      Way to make a first impression…At least I sat at the front? Only because I didn’t see any other seats close to me. 
      And surprisingly the computing cohort is like a 70 / 30 split for guys and girls. But we’ll get our actual groups tomorrow.
      After that I went for a walk around the campus. 
      As in literally looped around twice because I didn’t know I could go through the specific gates…I thought they were just for lorries and cars. 
      But yes you can go through them. Least I know now.
      
      After I did the welcome fair and got told about a crap ton of information I saw this “friend group” and thought I should tag along. No harm right? Except when this girl asked me “what do I play?” I was like “like video game consoles”
      “No Benjamin…what instrument do you play?”
      And that point I knew I didn’t join a casual friend group going around together … I joined a music group. 
      Miraculously, someone knew me and so I went with him after I explained to their music professor what the fuck a Computer Science student is doing with the musically inclined.
      We got lunch and drinks at Wetherspoons, I listened to my newfound group try out new guitars (they’re really good!) and yeah that’s kinda how it went down. 
      I met some new people and made some new friends in the weirdest way possible. 😌

    <h1>Day 2: Second Chances</h1>
    <p>
      I actually managed to get on the train this time. 
      Go me. 
      I got there pretty early because I wanted to do a bit of exploring. 
      Like Dora the Explorer just yknow way smexier. 
      I managed to find a park nearby that was pretty quiet and peaceful and tons of shortcuts to the university. 
      I think I’ll just stick to one route which consists of like two right turns and the rest are straightaways.
      After my amazing McDonald’s I went back to do some calligraphy. 
      It’s like a fancy form of handwriting where you gotta stroke it correctly. Wink.
      I also met someone. She seemed alright. 
      It’s also in the student union building which looks new, has a claw machine and a cafeteria. 
      But I had to end the session early because of my lecture. 
      It’s fucking annoying how half the events I can’t even attend because of my course (tragic I know) but eh opportunity cost innit.
      Also I didn’t know this but if a lecture starts at 2pm…you can’t just rock up at 2pm. 
      Once again I was the last one in. 
      I thought it’s like school but I guess not, gotta be early for some reason? 
      Maybe it’s the fresher week thing and afterwards people start not giving a shit. 
      I also made friends with someone who actually does Computer Science. 
      And I think someone on my train was also in my class, but they looked busy and I didn’t exactly want to disturb 'em.
