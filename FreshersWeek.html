    <h1>Day 1: The Worst (And Best) First Day At University‚Ä¶ </h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to the little shit (aka my brother) who took too long doing his hair. <br> 
      As well as a tragic car crash next to the train station. <br> 
      I missed the train. <br> 
      So I arrived at university kinda pissed off and kinda sweaty. <br> 
      Then I actually had to go into my introductory lecture half an hour late. 
      (I call it fashionably late but I don‚Äôt think anyone else in that hall did.) <br> 
      Way to make a first impression‚Ä¶At least I sat at the front? <br> 
      Only because I didn‚Äôt see any other seats close to me. <br> 
      And surprisingly the computing cohort is like a 70 / 30 split for guys and girls. But we‚Äôll get our actual groups tomorrow. <br> 
      After that I went for a walk around the campus. <br> 
      As in literally looped around twice because I didn‚Äôt know I could go through the specific gates‚Ä¶I thought they were just for lorries and cars. <br> 
      But yes you can go through them. Least I know now. <br> 
      After I did the welcome fair and got told about a crap ton of information I saw this ‚Äúfriend group‚Äù and thought I should tag along. 
      No harm right? Except when this girl asked me: <br> 
      ‚ÄúWhat do I play?‚Äù <br> 
      I was like ‚ÄúLike video game consoles?‚Äù <br> 
      ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶what instrument do you play?‚Äù <br> 
      And that point I knew I didn‚Äôt join a casual friend group going around together ‚Ä¶ I joined a music group. <br> 
      Miraculously, someone knew me and so I went with him... <br>  
      After I explained to their music professor what the fuck a Computer Science student is doing with the musically inclined. <br> 
      We got lunch and drinks at Wetherspoons, I listened to my newfound group try out new guitars (they‚Äôre really good!) and yeah that‚Äôs kinda how it went down. <br> 
      I met some new people and made some new friends in the weirdest way possible. üòå <br> 
    </p>

    <h1>Day 2: Second Chances</h1>
    <p>
      I actually managed to get on the train this time. <br> 
      Go me. <br> 
      I got there pretty early because I wanted to do a bit of exploring. <br> 
      Like Dora the Explorer just yknow way smexier. <br> 
      I managed to find a park nearby that was pretty quiet and peaceful and tons of shortcuts to the university. <br> 
      I think I‚Äôll just stick to one route which consists of like two right turns and the rest are straightaways. <br> 
      After my amazing McDonald‚Äôs I went back to do some calligraphy. <br> 
      It‚Äôs like a fancy form of handwriting where you gotta stroke it correctly. Wink. <br> 
      I also met someone. She seemed alright. <br> 
      It‚Äôs also in the student union building which looks new, has a claw machine and a cafeteria. <br> 
      But I had to end the session early because of my lecture. <br> 
      It‚Äôs fucking annoying how half the events I can‚Äôt even attend because of my course (tragic I know) but eh opportunity cost innit. <br> 
      Also I didn‚Äôt know this but if a lecture starts at 2pm‚Ä¶you can‚Äôt just rock up at 2pm. <br> 
      Once again I was the last one in. <br> 
      I thought it‚Äôs like school but I guess not, gotta be early for some reason? <br> 
      Maybe it‚Äôs the fresher week thing and afterwards people start not giving a shit. <br> 
      I also made friends with someone who actually does Computer Science. <br> 
      And I think someone on my train was also in my class, but they looked busy and I didn‚Äôt exactly want to disturb 'em. <br> 
    </p>

    <h1> Day 3: Fresher's Fair Fun</h1>
    <p>
      Wandered around for a bit and actually turned up somewhat early. <br> 
      I think 10 mins early for a lecture is good enough. <br> 
      I like standing up for a bit before my ass is seated for multiple hours. <br> 
      Now I know who was on my train. <br> 
      Did I even attempt to have a conversation with them? <br> 
      Ofc not I‚Äôm an introverted little bitch too scared to do anything except sit behind‚Ä¶but they're pretty cool. <br> 
      Maybe tomorrow I‚Äôll work up some courage or something. (Future Benjamin here - I didn't) <br> 
      After that was Fresher's Fair. <br> 
      It was so fuckin' crowded and sweaty and noisy so not fun but I got a ton of free loot and a ton of incoming spam. <br> 
      I managed to get a few phone numbers of people so who knows? <br> 
      Then after Burger King I went back for this Cafe Social event. <br> 
      Which isn‚Äôt in a cafe and wasn‚Äôt even social because NO ONE EXCEPT ME turned up. <br> 
      Kinda awkward. <br> 
      Anyway the lady running the thing showed me around the actual art / music / graphic design building which was nice of her. <br> 
      And I even did some kitchen litho artwork. <br> 
      Came out scuffed as hell but it worked for a first attempt which was fortunate. <br> 
      I then met some of the board game people up top and they got quite a collection. <br> 
      Then home time, I did what I needed to do and extra and tbh I‚Äôm too drained for anything else for today. <br> 
    </p>

    <h1>Day 4: What's A PAT?</h1>
    <p>
      Who doesn‚Äôt love a wander around first thing in the morning. <br> 
      Apart from crippled people. Whatever I found more parks and more cafes around. <br> 
      Maybe if I‚Äôm feeling fancy I‚Äôll check them out. <br> 
      Seems like no one set their alarms today since the class was pretty dead. <br> 
      Like less than a third capacity. <br> 
      Oh well, we aren‚Äôt exactly learning content... but it‚Äôs good to build a consistent routine when you haven‚Äôt done that for the past year. <br> 
      I gotta start getting some people who actually turn up because group work innit. <br> 
      But luckily all computer based courses do the same thing for the first year so everyone gets to know each other. <br> 
      Eventually‚Ä¶Woot. I had a lovely Tesco meal deal. At least pasta and chicken is kinda healthy? Better than the fast food I‚Äôve had so far. <br> 
      Then we met our personal academic tutor (PAT). By we I mean 5 of us. Out of like 17 people who were supposed to be there. <br> 
      He‚Äôs pretty chill and funny. And let us go 40 mins early. <br> 
      Then I speed walked to the station from campus and did it in like 12 minutes. It usually takes 15 depending on waiting for crossing lights, traffic etc. <br> 
      Don‚Äôt think my classmate did though coz he also takes the train. Tragic. <br> 
      No events today because I had lectures during them. Kinda annoying because there was live music and lots of paint and powder all over campus. <br> 
  </p>

    <h1>Day 5: Snitches and Switches</h1>
    <p>
      So yknow how I was like late to my two lectures and learnt ‚Äúoh I should probably come in earlier‚Äù. <br> 
      Turns out I should also peep inside first because I definitely didn‚Äôt waltz right into an introduction for psychology not computing. <br> 
      Least the students got a laugh so that‚Äôs fine... <br> 
      Before you say anything; I was in the RIGHT room, but WRONG time. I can follow a timetable. <br> 
      I had McDonald‚Äôs afterwards, idc I walk enough steps to burn off the calories. <br> 
      Plus I‚Äôm still finding cafes and whatever so for now it‚Äôs fast yummy food. <br> 
      Then after lunch I went to the fancy library building and‚Ä¶our lecturer straight up didn‚Äôt show up. <br> 
      We (the quarter of the class) all checked our outlook emails, notifications and nothing. So that was very awkward. <br> 
      But I wasn‚Äôt leaving on a low note so I went upstairs and there‚Äôs a StressLess session. <br> 
      Luckily this one had actual people in it, except they were all ladies and were doing their nails? <br> 
      I think. Didn‚Äôt really see nor care. They had a Nintendo Wii though which was nice. <br> 
      I even got complimented on my amazing Just Dance skills. <br> 
      I think the girls were laughing too. <br> 
      Like in a ‚Äúaww he‚Äôs adorable‚Äù way not ‚Äúhaha fucking loser‚Äù I hope. <br> 
      I then told the staff about 'the computing lecture that never happened' and the fact we didn‚Äôt get told anything. <br> 
      Turns out she can contact all the higher ups so uhh sorry for that person coz she seemed more pissed off than me. <br> 
      The train back was awkward since it was delayed due to electrical problems somewhere else but oh well. <br> 
      Least I can rest properly now and prepare for next week when it actually start for realsies. <br>
