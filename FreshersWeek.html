    <h1>Day 1: The Worst (And Best) First Day At University… </h1>
    <p>
      Thanks to the little shit (aka my brother) who took too long doing his hair as well as a tragic car crash next to the train station…I missed the train. 
      So I arrived at university kinda pissed off and kinda sweaty. 
      Then I actually had to go into my introductory lecture half an hour late. (I call it fashionably late but I don’t think anyone else in that hall did.) 
      Way to make a first impression…At least I sat at the front? Only because I didn’t see any other seats close to me. 
      And surprisingly the computing cohort is like a 70 / 30 split for guys and girls. But we’ll get our actual groups tomorrow.
      After that I went for a walk around the campus. 
      As in literally looped around twice because I didn’t know I could go through the specific gates…I thought they were just for lorries and cars. 
      But yes you can go through them. Least I know now.
      
      After I did the welcome fair and got told about a crap ton of information I saw this “friend group” and thought I should tag along. No harm right? Except when this girl asked me “what do I play?” I was like “like video game consoles”
      “No Benjamin…what instrument do you play?”
      And that point I knew I didn’t join a casual friend group going around together … I joined a music group. 
      Miraculously, someone knew me and so I went with him after I explained to their music professor what the fuckk a computer science student is doing with the musically inclined and his actual friend group to Wetherspoons. 
      We drank, I listened to my newfound group try out new guitars (they’re really good!) and yeah that’s kinda how it went down. 
      I made some new friends in the weirdest way possible. 😌
