    <h1> Day 10: Well, That Sucks - 2nd October 2023 </h1>
    <p>
      I made it into double digit days and survived. 
      In the gaming biz we “take those” so yay for me. 
      And for the first Monday ever I wasn’t late. 
      I almost was because the train was delayed but I’m just built different.
      First lecture was pretty dry. 
      It’s like replaying a tutorial, we still didn’t learn much. 
      But the enterprise people came in which was nice and more interesting tbh. 
      But my chances with someone are at a big fat zero now because...yeah. 
      I’ll get over it very quickly don’t worry. 
      Yet again like five people I didn’t even know existed showed up including him.
      After that I hung out with my classmate for a bit.
      And got a Greggs sausage roll because I was kinda hungry. 
      Then I went back on campus and attempted to help a new student. 
      (I say attempted coz he found a staff member anyway) 
      But he still said thanks :)
      Then second lecture time. 
      Whoever thought it was a smart idea to put two lectures of the same topic needs to get their head checked. 
      And all we did was take notes while listening to a podcast. 
      Luckily I’m super good at taking notes thanks to school and my job so easy peasy. 
      I feel bad for the international students though because they talk fast. 
      And having to process words is difficult enough. 
      It’s like when I did French and you had to listen to them speaking a paragraph…
      I think I just copied off Maddy back then icl.
      We have to upload our notes to the whole class. 
      Even if we didn’t an international student took a picture of my notes anyway. 
      I couldn’t care less to be honest because it’s just notes. 
      So no point gatekeeping with your stuff I think. 
      Just hope people can read what I wrote.
    </p>
    
    <h1> Day 11: Confidence Ablaze </h1>
    <p>
      Did some walking before uni…whatever not important. 
      I managed to pluck up some courage and actually take part during the workshop. 
      Don’t ask me how or why, I just did. It was pretty easy stuff anyway but the main focus was the methods.
      After that I got some Greggs and went back to the library to do some work. 
      How the fuck are people partying and getting drunk I honestly don’t know…there’s so much to do. 
      Whatever I’m not exactly the type to meet loads of random strangers anyway so I really don’t care. 
      Then a fire alarm went off which really killed the vibes, and it wasn’t a test or anything it was a real fire because we couldn’t go back inside right after. 
      So I decided to head back to campus…
      For some reason they wanted to elect course representatives now. 
      Normally I wouldn’t but fuck it, I’m gonna do my own thing. 
      So I went up and that was a mistake and a half. 
      You had to explain yourself on the spot why you wanted to be one. 
      And to be honest I kinda fumbled my lines. 
      Doesn’t help with the entire lecture hall looking at you but oh well more public speaking experience is good. 
      But what came next was despair-inducing. The voting.
      **And no one voted for me.**
      Not one person. 
      Hell, some people didn’t even vote. 
      It felt like time froze and it was agony. 
      My face probably said it all, not even one person for shits and giggles? The sheer embarrassment, awkwardness and humiliation was immense. 
      I kinda just slumped down in my seat afterwards. 
      Pretty sure I heard some murmuring too so I really felt good about that. 
      I even walked back to the train station alone. 
      I just wasn’t in the mood for people. Obviously. 
      No hate to the new course reps, I’m sure they’ll be amazing…I just need to reflect.
    </p>

    <h1> Day 12: Remote Controlled </h1>
    <p>
      This is gonna be quite short since I couldn’t get into university because of the train strike.
      I swear they sorted out a deal not long ago? Oh well, to be honest there were loads of people online. 
      The actual classroom must’ve been dead as hell then. 
      I actually like messaging my responses, I get people being anxious to respond IRL but online? 
      Come on no need to hide (though I would not be surprised if half the online people just left it in the background to play video games or watch Netflix)
      At least I’m ahead now, kinda have to be since I want to work during university too. 
      My boss is nice enough to let me work whenever I can since he also did a degree so he kinda knows the lack of energy and free time. 
      No fucking around and finding out.
    </p>

    <h1> Day 13: Artist, Executor, Influencer</h1>
    <p>
      Long ass day but I guess that’s how the university experience goes? 
      I get in early because I’m more productive and I’m not gonna get tempted to play on my PS5 while I’m miles away from it. 
      It’s mainly programming I need to work on because it’s like a skill, if you don’t do it ya get rusty. 
      I genuinely forgot how quiet it’s supposed to be without music. 
      Anyways after I get McDonald’s (it’s my only one this week gosh) 
      I go back to do the StressLess event, round 2. 
      This time the theme was sustainability. So no dance moves this time. 
      But I designed a tote bag using fabric paint and did some lasagna pasta artwork. 
      Because it’s translucent (kinda see through) you can trace images onto it and colour them with markers. 
      Ironically enough, according to my course leader “computer scientists are just as creative as artists because they have to solve problems with limitations” 
      So technically I can say it’s helping my education…
      Plus I was tired looking at code all morning. 
      Oh yeah, I’m also on the university’s social media feed so that’s something I didn’t expect would happen.
      After that was my actual coding workshop, nothing special really. 
      I’m in the “done some programming before” group which is good because they don’t have to spoon feed us information.
