    <h1> Day 10: Well, That Sucks - 2nd October 2023 </h1>
    <p>
      I made it into double digit days and survived. <br>
      In the gaming biz we “take those” so yay for me. <br>
      And for the first Monday ever I wasn’t late. <br>
      I almost was because the train was delayed but I’m just built different. <br>
      First lecture was pretty dry. <br>
      It’s like replaying a tutorial, we still didn’t learn much. <br>
      But the enterprise people came in which was nice and more interesting tbh. <br>
      But my chances with someone are at a big fat zero now because...yeah. <br>
      I’ll get over it very quickly don’t worry. <br>
      Yet again like five people I didn’t even know existed showed up including him. <br>
      After that I hung out with my classmate for a bit. <br>
      And got a Greggs sausage roll because I was kinda hungry. <br>
      Then I went back on campus and attempted to help a new student. <br>
      (I say attempted coz he found a staff member anyway) <br>
      But he still said thanks :) <br>
      Then second lecture time. <br>
      Whoever thought it was a smart idea to put two lectures of the same topic needs to get their head checked. <br>
      And all we did was take notes while listening to a podcast. <br>
      Luckily I’m super good at taking notes thanks to school and my job so easy peasy. <br>
      I feel bad for the international students though because they talk fast. <br>
      And having to process words is difficult enough. <br>
      It’s like when I did French and you had to listen to them speaking a paragraph… <br>
      I think I just copied off my friends back then icl. <br>
      We have to upload our notes to the whole class. <br>
      Even if we didn’t an international student took a picture of my notes anyway. <br>
      I couldn’t care less to be honest because it’s just notes. <br>
      So no point gatekeeping with your stuff I think. <br>
      Just hope people can read what I wrote. <br>
    </p>
    
    <h1> Day 11: Confidence Ablaze </h1>
    <p>
      Did some walking before uni…whatever not important. <br>
      I managed to pluck up some courage and actually take part during the workshop. <br>
      Don’t ask me how or why, I just did. It was pretty easy stuff anyway but the main focus was the methods. <br>
      After that I got some Greggs and went back to the library to do some work. <br>
      How the fuck are people partying and getting drunk I honestly don’t know…there’s so much to do. <br>
      Whatever I’m not exactly the type to meet loads of random strangers anyway so I really don’t care. <br>
      Then a fire alarm went off which really killed the vibes. 
      And it wasn’t a test or anything it was a real fire because we couldn’t go back inside right after. <br>
      So I decided to head back to campus… <br>
      For some reason they wanted to elect course representatives now. <br>
      Normally I wouldn’t but fuck it, I’m gonna do my own thing. <br>
      So I went up and that was a mistake and a half. <br>
      You had to explain yourself on the spot why you wanted to be one. <br>
      And to be honest I kinda fumbled my lines. <br>
      Doesn’t help with the entire lecture hall looking at you but oh well more public speaking experience is good. <br>
      But what came next was despair-inducing. The voting. <br>
      **And no one voted for me.** <br>
      Not one person. <br>
      Hell, some people didn’t even vote. <br>
      It felt like time froze and it was agony. <br>
      My face probably said it all, not even one person for shits and giggles? <br>
      The sheer embarrassment, awkwardness and humiliation was immense. <br>
      I kinda just slumped down in my seat afterwards. <br>
      Pretty sure I heard some murmuring too so I really felt good about that. <br>
      I even walked back to the train station alone. <br>
      I just wasn’t in the mood for people. Obviously. <br>
      No hate to the new course reps, I’m sure they’ll be amazing…I just need to reflect. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 12: Remote Controlled </h1>
    <p>
      This is gonna be quite short since I couldn’t get into university because of the train strike. <br>
      I swear they sorted out a deal not long ago? <br>
      Oh well, to be honest there were loads of people online. <br>
      The actual classroom must’ve been dead as hell then. <br>
      I actually like messaging my responses, I get people being anxious to respond IRL but online? <br>
      Come on no need to hide (though I would not be surprised if half the online people just left it in the background to play video games or watch Netflix) <br>
      At least I’m ahead now, kinda have to be since I want to work during university too. <br>
      My boss is nice enough to let me work whenever I can since he also did a degree so he kinda knows the lack of energy and free time. <br>
      No fucking around and finding out. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 13: Artist, Executor, Influencer</h1>
    <p>
      Long ass day but I guess that’s how the university experience goes? <br>
      I get in early because I’m more productive and I’m not gonna get tempted to play on my PS5 while I’m miles away from it. <br>
      It’s mainly programming I need to work on because it’s like a skill, if you don’t do it ya get rusty. <br>
      I genuinely forgot how quiet it’s supposed to be without music. <br>
      Anyways after I get McDonald’s (it’s my only one this week gosh) <br>
      I go back to do the StressLess event, round 2. <br>
      This time the theme was sustainability. So no dance moves this time. <br>
      But I designed a tote bag using fabric paint and did some lasagna pasta artwork. <br>
      Because it’s translucent (kinda see through) you can trace images onto it and colour them with markers. <br>
      Ironically enough, according to my course leader “computer scientists are just as creative as artists because they have to solve problems with limitations” <br>
      So technically I can say it’s helping my education… <br>
      Plus I was tired looking at code all morning. <br>
      Oh yeah, I’m also on the university’s social media feed so that’s something I didn’t expect would happen. <br>
      After that was my actual coding workshop, nothing special really. <br>
      I’m in the “done some programming before” group which is good because they don’t have to spoon feed us information. <br>
    </p>
