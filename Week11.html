    <h1> Day 14: Groups of Death - 9th October 2023</h1>
    <p>
    So turns out like airplane flights, lectures rooms can be overbooked too. 
    Wow. At least I find a quiet spot in the library. 
    Had to buy some new earbuds in cyan too because my silver ones don’t have a mic. 
    Thank goodness it worked and my group could hear me. 
    It felt kinda weird talking but getting no response back. 
    Like a YouTuber when they talk into the camera. Whatever, the lecture wasn’t too thrilling apart from the technical issues.
    After my Greggs I went back (obviously…I have two lectures) and yay group work. 
    Didn’t even get to pick since I just got randomly picked into one. 
    But they had these cubes with mics in em and since everyone else in my group was a bitch I had to…well present. Scary? 
    Yes. But maybe I can get used to it now…maybe. 
    I then started doing part of my actual assignment because the train wasn’t for an hour and that’s kinda it. 
    Helped a new guy out (I think, I would’ve taken him but I would’ve been very late to class lol)
    </p>

    <h1> Day 15: Bubble Trouble and Pizza </h1>
    <p>
      You already know how it goes. 
      Get in, walk around, do some coursework in the library. 
      Then first lecture time.
      Pretty uneventful tbh. 
      I mean it’s still early days and new people are still showing up so nothing exciting is gonna happen. 
      But I learnt how to code a flowchart so that’s neat.
      Then I had Greggs (pizza coz I wanted to mix it up) and I saw “you know who”.
      I keep running into the pair of them which is kinda annoying. Is it like foreshadowing or something? 
      I don’t even know…but I went back to the library to work on programming. 
      But my code needs a major change because the programming language I’m using is a pain in the ass with variables so I’m not gonna have fun rewriting it.
      Then my other lecture for the day, we did maths (yay) and bubble sorting (double yay). 
      They obviously wanted to do a live demonstration so I pretty much felt obliged to stand up and ✨ participate in class ✨. 
      I sit at the very front coz I got no real friends…I wasn’t exactly gonna sneak out of doing it. 
      It was funny though seeing the lecturer basically begging a group of 45 adults to join in with her activity. 
      That’s it I guess. Nothing mind blowing crazy but sometimes that’s okay.
    </p>

    <h1> Day 16: Paper, Lego, Metal </h1>
    <p>
      Morning is pretty much the same as always. 
      But I saw someone I knew from school (finally!) so now that’s everyone I’ve seen in university that I care about. 
      And some other randoms too I guess. Managed to knock out a solid bit of assessments before the afternoon lecture so I can chill out for a bit. 
      I guess that’s one perk of not having a girlfriend, you don’t gotta choose between things. Freedom innit.
      Then I talked to my university classmate for a bit and explained our timetable. 
      We have an academic development week so there isn’t any timetabled lectures. 
      But I might still come in just to get out the house yknow? Coz I barely leave it as is 
      Then the fun bits. Lecture was boring as hell so we can just skip it. 
      So right after it I went back to the library to do this Lego Therapy session. 
      Sounds technical but it was adorable a fun co op game where one person builds but can’t see the blueprint. 
      And the other sees the blueprint but can’t build. 
      It actually helped me understand algorithms more and how specific you gotta be…and also gave me an excuse to build Lego.
      Then after I get Greggs I go back to the cafe social. 
      Initially I was only gonna go to get my print from a few weeks back, but I decided fuck it I’m here let’s participate. 
      The international students there actually study in Japan, they come here for a year to learn English which is cool. 
      Glad someone wasn’t here coz he’d rizz them all up. 
      We built paper lanterns and it was so finicky. I also built mine kinda wrong but like it was my first attempt. 
      I then waved goodbye to everyone, got my print and now I’m at the train station. 
      I probably could’ve got the earlier one if I legged it but I’d rather not look like an goofball. 
      People running for the train looks so funny to me icl. So whatever.
    </p>

    <h1>Day 17: Open Market, Closed Source</h1>
    <p>
      The usual start happens, go into the library to finish bits off. 
      One of the staff members already recognised me which I don’t know if that’s good or bad. 
      Anyways I get out to get some McDonald’s and I walk into some massive open market. 
      That’s nice for the international students since a load of it was like foreign cuisine. 
      Nice taste of home innit. But nothing for me since Filipino food is very salty. Not joking. 
      Then I attend my only lecture and it was pretty chill. 
      I actually managed to fix my code, literally had to add in three letters. 
      Next week is gonna be “fun” because it’s full on. So gotta get prepared for that…
