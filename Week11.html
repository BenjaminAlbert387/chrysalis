    <h1> Day 14: Groups of Death - 9th October 2023</h1>
    <p>
    So turns out like airplane flights, lectures rooms can be overbooked too. <br>
    Wow. At least I find a quiet spot in the library. <br>
    Had to buy some new earbuds in cyan too because my silver ones don’t have a mic. <br>
    Thank goodness it worked and my group could hear me. <br>
    It felt kinda weird talking but getting no response back. <br>
    Like a YouTuber when they talk into the camera. <br>
    Whatever, the lecture wasn’t too thrilling apart from the technical issues. <br>
    After my Greggs I went back (obviously…I have two lectures) and yay group work. <br>
    Didn’t even get to pick since I just got randomly picked into one. <br>
    But they had these cubes with mics in em and since everyone else in my group was a bitch I had to…well present. <br>
    Scary? Yes. But maybe I can get used to it now…maybe. <br>
    I then started doing part of my actual assignment because the train wasn’t for an hour and that’s kinda it. <br>
    Helped a new guy out too. (I think, I would’ve taken him but I would’ve been very late to class lol) <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 15: Bubble Trouble and Pizza </h1>
    <p>
      You already know how it goes. <br>
      Get in, walk around, do some coursework in the library. <br>
      Then first lecture time. <br>
      Pretty uneventful tbh. <br>
      I mean it’s still early days and new people are still showing up so nothing exciting is gonna happen. <br>
      But I learnt how to code a flowchart so that’s neat. <br>
      Then I had Greggs (pizza coz I wanted to mix it up) and I saw “you know who”. <br>
      I keep running into the pair of them which is kinda annoying. Is it like foreshadowing or something? <br>
      I don’t even know…but I went back to the library to work on programming. <br>
      But my code needs a major change because the programming language I’m using is a pain in the ass with variables. <br>
      I’m not gonna have fun rewriting it. <br>
      Then my other lecture for the day, we did maths (yay) and bubble sorting (double yay). <br>
      They obviously wanted to do a live demonstration so I pretty much felt obliged to stand up and ✨ participate in class ✨. <br>
      I sit at the very front coz I got no real friends…I wasn’t exactly gonna sneak out of doing it. <br>
      It was funny though seeing the lecturer basically begging a group of 45 adults to join in with her activity. <br>
      That’s it I guess. Nothing mind blowing crazy but sometimes that’s okay. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 16: Paper, Lego, Metal </h1>
    <p>
      Morning is pretty much the same as always. <br>
      But I saw someone I knew from school (finally!) so now that’s everyone I’ve seen in university that I care about. <br>
      And some other randoms too I guess. Managed to knock out a solid bit of assessments before the afternoon lecture so I can chill out for a bit. <br>
      I guess that’s one perk of not having a girlfriend, you don’t gotta choose between things. Freedom innit. <br>
      Then I talked to my university classmate for a bit and explained our timetable. <br>
      We have an academic development week so there isn’t any timetabled lectures. <br>
      But I might still come in just to get out the house yknow? Coz I barely leave it as is. <br> 
      Then the fun bits. Lecture was boring as hell so we can just skip it. <br>
      So right after it I went back to the library to do this Lego Therapy session. <br>
      Sounds technical but it was pretty cool. <br>
      A fun co op game where one person builds but can’t see the blueprint. <br>
      And the other sees the blueprint but can’t build. <br>
      It actually helped me understand algorithms more and how specific you gotta be…and also gave me an excuse to build Lego. <br>
      Then after I get Greggs I go back to the cafe social. <br>
      Initially I was only gonna go to get my print from a few weeks back, but I decided fuck it I’m here let’s participate. <br>
      The international students there actually study in Japan, they come here for a year to learn English which is cool. <br>
      Glad someone wasn’t here coz he’d rizz them all up. <br>
      We built paper lanterns and it was so finicky. <br>
      I also built mine kinda wrong but like it was my first attempt. <br>
      I then waved goodbye to everyone, got my print and now I’m at the train station. <br>
      I probably could’ve got the earlier one if I legged it but I’d rather not look like an goofball. <br>
      People running for the train looks so funny to me icl. So whatever. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Day 17: Open Market, Closed Source</h1>
    <p>
      The usual start happens, go into the library to finish bits off. <br>
      One of the staff members already recognised me which I don’t know if that’s good or bad. <br>
      Anyways I get out to get some McDonald’s and I walk into some massive open market. <br>
      That’s nice for the international students since a load of it was like foreign cuisine. <br>
      Nice taste of home innit. But nothing for me since Filipino food is very salty. Not joking. <br>
      Then I attend my only lecture and it was pretty chill. <br>
      I actually managed to fix my code, literally had to add in three letters. <br>
      Next week is gonna be “fun” because it’s full on. So gotta get prepared for that… <br>
