    <h1> Day 82: Returned and Ready (16th April 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Missed me, huh? <br>
      Tragically there’s only about three weeks left until university is officially done for me. <br>
      Exciting times. <br>
      Not much happening in the morning as usual. <br>
      Made a main menu for the group project game, it’s getting finished pretty quick. <br>
      Which is good because I got two other assignments to be finishing up. <br>
      Afternoon session was just maths stuff (probability but even harder than A Level Maths, yay!) then doing it in Python. <br>
      We also saw a sneak peek at the second maths assignment (First one I smashed it) and it’s tough. <br>
      But when has that stopped moi? <br>
      Also for once it’s actually somewhat sunny when I’m writing this, and not dark and depressing. <br>
      Kinda bittersweet, I didn’t know how fast this year would go by. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 83: On A Trans-Mission  </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing crazy today, got our marks back for the other assignment I did before Easter. <br>
      And I’m happy with them. :D <br>
      We did data transmission and I ate a pizza roll which was yummy. <br>
      Also continued on working on the user interface of our game. <br>
      I saw my usual university friends today which was nice, as well as the larger uni group. <br>
      Which has gotten smaller and smaller it’s a bit sad really. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 84: Uni Wars: The Academic Weapon Strikes Back </h1>
    <p>
      Normally I’d head off to the library to lock in and do assignments but... <br>
      It was seemingly closed with some very angry people with clipboards and construction workers outside it. <br>
      Weird. I just went to some quiet area on campus instead and did loads toward my assignment. <br>
      Grind it out now so I can relax later. Also because it’s good practice for next year. <br>
      Yknow when marks actually count. Scary. <br>
      Evening session I just continued on with my group project. <br>
      That one is due in just under two weeks. Scary. Glad it’s almost over though. <br>
      Being head honcho is tough when you’re responsible for a bunch of adults. <br>
      Attendance for these classes is downright miserable. <br>
      None of my group was in today so that was awkward. <br>
      Least Spotify keeps me sane. <br>
      Oh and I had McDonald’s for lunch. In case you was interested. <br>
      Still cute though! xo xo <br>
