    <h1> Day 18: It’s Well Cold, Innit - 16th October 2023 </h1>
    <p>
      Both of my lectures were online but I still went in because I like fresh air and not being stuck in the house. <br>
      Plus I needed to talk to the careers and enterprise people about something that doesn’t concern ya... <br>
      The lectures were kinda mid but we survive. <br>
      Almost fell asleep but my playlist started playing bangers back to back like an energy boost in an anime. <br>
      Yknow what I mean? <br>
      Tried the Greggs vegan sausage rolls because they ran out of the non vegan ones and they’re alright. <br>
      They don’t have the same meaty-ness but I’ve tasted worse vegan meat in my life. <br>

    <h1> Day 19: New Students, New Despair </h1>
    <p>
      They really gotta have a deadline for when you join university. 
      Like not being funny but how are people even allowed to join almost a month in? 
      Coz deadlines are coming up fast and hard. (Like me)
      Anyways I got a few people's phone number since group work, I got put with the new people which is fine I guess. 
      I like helping especially when they’re getting thrown in the deep end.
      After that I had Greggs and went to the library for my final edit for one part of my coursework. 
      Feels good. Then went back for programming which was just hard tbh. 
      I think people were getting restless mid way through. I want to submit stuff a week or so early because doing it last minute is stressful af...

    <h1> Day 20: Knowledge, Strength, Integrity </h1>
    <p>
      (No I didn’t get featured on the sidemen show)
      Pretty much finished one assignment so we take those. 
      Feels like a game of Among Us but the tasks don’t stop coming. 
      And the imposter is myself. Even done a bit of research with it too and with proper references. 
      Well I’m just relying on the software I downloaded to reference for me 😛 and it seems good soooo.
      After my lecture (nothing interesting happened in it) and McDonald’s I go back to the library to finish something else.
      And to light a fire under my group’s asses. Though the write up is individual there’s still a group element of it. 
      So their funeral if they hand it in late. (Though I’m stuck with the new international students)
      Tbh I think they should get an extension as they literally had less time than the day 1 students...
      Then I go downstairs and there’s this seemingly fun thing. 
      It wasn’t, it was academic integrity and using AI to basically write your shit for ya. 
      I “took a pledge” not to use it or whatever but I’m a way better writer than some dumb bot. 
      Besides ChatGPT can’t even do basic math if you trick it. And I got some free sweets too.
      And today marks exactly one month since I’ve started this?!
    </p>

    <h1> Day 21: Painter Royale </h1>
    <p>
      Had a meeting with my PAT today. 
      He’s super chill though I kinda felt awkward since the rest of the people who turned up were in foundation year. 
      But we did our development plan which was me basically saying I need to learn more coding and attending real life events or conferences. 
      Not those Fortnite ones. 
      Then I went back to the library to sort my essay out. 
      It sounds so dry and devoid of personality but I guess that what makes it "academic". 
      After that I do yet another StressLess event. Why? Because my laptop was on low battery tbh and I really couldn’t be asked for more writing. 
      I did some painting with bubble wrap, painted a rock funny colours and danced to Toxic on Just Dance 2. 
      I love busting out some moves, I can’t “normal dance” for shit but copying a few moves? 
      Easy. (I say easy but I probably look like I’m on ketamine to others. Oh well they can’t handle me 🔥) 
      Also the staff running it know me now which is nice.
      I’d try to bring people along but that’s way easier said than done. 
      There’s a girl  who also attends but I’m not even gonna attempt to rizz her up. 
      She has a boyfriend. I think most people in university do. 
      Am I fucked? Will I be single forever?
      Find out more in the next episode...now time to play Spider-Man 2. 
      And oh yeah my coding workshop went fine, I managed to do some solid working code. 
      Like a working multiplication table that prints out every line. 
      I hate having to do data validation though.
