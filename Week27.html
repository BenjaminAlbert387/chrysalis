    <h1> Day 54: The Filler Episode (30th January 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Pretend I did something here because I really didn‚Äôt. <br>
      Train strike which meant that no university for today, very tragic. <br>
      I have to bust out my old A Level Maths workbooks from the dark pits of‚Ä¶Anthony‚Äôs room. <br>
      Since the topics are similar. <br>
      Flipping logarithmic and exponentials... <br>
      I‚Äôm gonna cry. Or lock in. Either one. <br>
      (At least I don‚Äôt see any integration or differentiation‚Ä¶yet) <br>
      And coding this semester is a group coding project. <br>
      Yay. At least this time our lecturer hasn‚Äôt done it completely random. <br>
      She‚Äôs using personality tests and stuff to try and get well balanced groups. <br>
      Like the Pok√©mon equivalent of not having 5 Pok√©mon weak to one type. <br>
      It shall be fun‚Ä¶maybe? <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 55: Welcome Back‚Ä¶Or Something? </h1>
    <p>
      Yay I actually managed to arrive this time. <br>
      They were giving out sweets in the morning so... <br>
      You already know ya boy copped the Twix. <br>
      I am a Left Twix fan btw. <br>
      Not really relevant but whatever. <br>
      Most of the morning was just introductions and welcoming us back to our living nightmare. <br>
      Then I had Greggs and walked my friend back to his student accommodation. <br>
      He was just as bored as I am but he forgot his laptop... <br>
      I don‚Äôt know how but whatever. My uni squad was ‚Äúgetting gains‚Äù at the gym so I wasn‚Äôt with them. <br>
      But I still waved hi at them so nice seeing them alive. <br>
      I also had this orange canned fizzy drink and it was fine. <br>
      Apparently I look "funny" drinking canned stuff? üòê <br>
      Afternoon lab was chill I guess. <br>
      At least I have a regular schedule again instead of doing fuck all 24/7. <br>
      Also I think I got paid from my student ambassador role so that‚Äôs very poggers. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 56: The Extrovert Inside Me (Says Hi) </h1>
    <p>
      I have never talked so much before at university. <br>
      I‚Äôm surprised my mouth doesn‚Äôt hurt as much. <br>
      The morning was relatively chill until three people I knew rocked up. <br>
      Then one of them went off so I just talked to both of them about video games and university life for hours. <br>
      Genuinely, I didn‚Äôt leave the library until 3pm and that was only because I was hungry. <br>
      (I had a bacon and cheese wrap from Greggs) <br>
      The workshop itself was quite alright. <br>
      Our group was constantly laughing and I think it made the new lecturer surprised. <br>
      We weren‚Äôt like fucking around or anything we just had good vibes...on a topic about nukes, penguins and Russia. <br>
      I liked our little group but it‚Äôs a shame the ones for our actual group project for real will be fair randomly. <br>
      It‚Äôs based on personality and other factors. <br>
      (I assume coding skill level?) <br>
      Anyway I walked my friend back and then walked myself back to the train station. <br>
      Even helped an old lady on the way. <br>
      But my train got delayed so I was just waiting, <br>
      Luckily someone else was there and he‚Äôs chill. <br>
      Just like me fr, we have the same interests. <br>
      University is crazy coz I‚Äôve made friends with the most random people possible it‚Äôs kinda nice. <br>
      I think I‚Äôll relax for tonight and ‚Äúget busy‚Äù at nighttime. <br>
