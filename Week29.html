    <h1> Day 60: Binary, Non Binary and Everything Else (13th February 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      The non binary thing isn‚Äôt really relevant today. <br>
      I just needed something fancy for my title. <br>
      Clickbait master :P <br>
      But the majority of the day was doing Maths. <br>
      Binary, Hexadecimal, Octa and Decimal. The entire squad. <br>
      During the half hour break between classes me and my friend. <br> 
      (or "My friend and I" if you‚Äôre an English nerd) <br>
      went to KFC and then went clothes shopping. <br>
      He went to some fancy place for a collar shirt. <br> 
      And wow they really give you customer service. <br>
      This is why I rarely buy clothes in person coz I do not want to have chit chat with some salesman. <br>
      I sorta just stood waiting holding his two chicken wraps. <br>
      None for me because I kid you not the last thing he ate was pizza. <br>
      At half 5 in the morning then went to bed. <br>
      Explains why he overslept... <br>
      Programming was relatively chill. <br> 
      The people behind us kept giggling. <br> 
      Like school boys seeing the word penis in the dictionary. <br>
      It annoyed my mate to no end though, meanwhile I was trying hard not to join in. <br>
      We truly are different. üôÇ <br>
      And I added someone on Pok√©mon GO. <br>
      That was a fun conversation, I knew he liked Dragon Ball. <br>
      Coz he wears a Goku hoodie in class. But damn he is cultured af. <br>
      It almost feels like a video game, learning about everyone a bit more and a bit more. <br>
      Or maybe I need to get off the internet and get on some weights. Jk. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 61: V is For...  </h1>
    <p>
      Ugh. Yep, it‚Äôs the day society gaslights single people that they suck and should feel bad for not being in a relationship. <br>
      I‚Äôve seen more bouquets of flowers today than I have seen people in an actual flower garden. <br>
      Whatever. My day is probably at least 69% more interesting than Valentine‚Äôs. <br>
      Today I sat next to my friend for my lessons, my other friend came in kinda late which is surprising. <br>
      Hope he fixes his sleep schedule soon. Both of them are pretty smart, yet still needs my help on some stuff. <br>
      We were learning about languages. <br>
      Not those modern foreign languages and certainly not love languages, coding ones. <br>
      Duh. I‚Äôll spare you the details but it was alright. <br>
      Then I went to the library for some ‚ú® volunteering ‚ú®. <br>
      Friends went home anyway and I wanted to get out of my comfort zone for a bit. <br>
      It was pretty scary and I didn‚Äôt really do much, just help monitor the stand and help put up some things. <br>
      Did it for an hour so that‚Äôs fun. Then I got myself a free McSpicy burger and went back on campus. <br>
      I was with my other mate for a little bit longer then headed to class. <br>
      We pretty much just learnt how to use said coding language. <br>
      Really exciting except the part where the lecturer uses my work as an example. <br>
      I just put random names for comments like ‚Äúedit 4 real‚Äù and ‚Äúedittt‚Äù so that totally didn‚Äôt spook me. <br>
      I also got mini jumpscared twice today, one by the careers lady and one by someone in the uni group. <br>
      And an actual jump when my phone went off. IT WAS ON SILENT. <br>
      And I have the FNAF song as my ringtone so that was awkward. <br>
      (I still do, it's too iconic now) <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 62: Duos - No Fill  </h1>
    <p>
     Morning nothing interesting happened just did some maths assignment. <br> 
      Who knew starting it early would be beneficial in the long run. <br>
      Then I was helping out in the StressLess event thingy. <br>
      They kinda already set everything up so‚Ä¶I was testing out the Wii games they had. <br>
      That was alright, I also met someone. She‚Äôs nice. <br>
      I helped her since she actually recognised her from the photoshoot thing I did last semester. <br>
      I didn‚Äôt have a clue. <br>
      Also annoyingly the university doesn‚Äôt have a battery disposal bin. <br>
      I felt it would be a bit hypocritical if I‚Äôm doing a unit on reducing e-waste. <br>
      Yet dumped a ton of Wii remote batteries into a bin. <br>
      So I found the nearby Lidl and a nice man led me to the battery disposal bin. <br>
      5 stars customer service. And I guess I got my steps in. <br>
      Then I had some Greggs since I was hungry (duh) and went to the Touchdown Cafe quiet area. <br>
      To do more work. I‚Äôm **locking the fuck in.** <br>
      This surely can not be bad for my mental health ‚ú® <br>
      The actual lesson today was just more group stuff for our group project. <br>
      I say group, but only me and one other person were in. 2 out of a possible 6. <br>
      Damn. We really didn‚Äôt do too much, mainly just setting up and preparing for real. <br>
      At least our project got approved. <br>
      I‚Äôm sleepy but I‚Äôll eat dinner then play some PlayStation. <br>
      That‚Äôs if people don‚Äôt piss me off first and I just get off the game annoyed. <br>
