    <h1> Day 79: Primary Expertise (26th March 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      A fun day?! No way. <br>
      Today wasn’t the usual since I had some volunteering event I wanted to do. <br>
      Also because I tactically skipped out on maths and computing lectures. <br>
      It was the “Primary Engineer” day. <br>
      Where me and a bunch of other people basically became examiner. <br>
      And graded kids on how wacky their ideas were if they became an engineer. Kids are so creative. And ruthless. <br>
      I also got a free drink and lunch which was nice and met some really cool people in the industry. <br>
      And it’s another 7 hours added onto my volunteering. <br>
      Rest of the day was pretty dry. <br>
      Maths fun and I could only do one question correctly. <br>
      The other ones I made a right mess but oh well you live you learn. <br>
      I also chatted to one of my friends on the way home. <br>
      Overall really nice and fun day. <br>
      Did I mention I wore bunny ears on campus? <br>
      Loads of people noticed it which was very sweet. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 80: Penultimate Perfection </h1>
    <p>
      Not much I can really write about, same shit different day yknow? <br>
      I think it was Offer Holder day or something like that because the campus was packed. <br>
      (Tbh I don’t know why they keep taking down and putting up the location help stuff. They may as well be permanent.) <br>
      This also meant that we had an online class and then a hybrid class in some random room. <br>
      Fun. But it was all easy stuff anyway, and I can get started on the second assignment. <br>
      University life is doable if you even have a sense of responsibility. <br>
      And not play video games with an assignment looming over. <br>
      But Easter can’t come soon enough! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 81: An Egg-Citing Presentation </h1>
    <p>
      And today is the final day before Easter break begins! <br>
      I need a rest for real. <br>
      Got through most of the assignment 2 that was set yesterday which is lovely to see. <br>
      In the morning, that is. <br>
      Then we had to wait over half an hour because of “technical difficulties” from previous groups before us. <br>
      Not fun, we were a member down. But the remaining members powered though it. <br>
      And by that I mean I basically did most of the talking. <br>
      If you told me a year ago I’d be leading a group as well as presenting in front of lecturers. <br>
      I would have probably laughed at you. I guess you really do become what you fear most. <br>
      Like that Anakin bloke. <br>
      I said happy Easter to almost all my mates too, luckily I saw them so I got to chat in person. <br>
      Just happened to be that they were outside a…vape shop. <br>
      Whatever. Maybe I’ll see them over summer? <br>
