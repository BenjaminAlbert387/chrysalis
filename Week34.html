    <h1> Day 76: Synchro Summoning and GitHub Blundering (19th March 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      My morning was anything but good. <br>
      First my earbuds were playing up and not connecting. <br>
      Then Unity was having a nightmare and turned all of my artwork into bright pink squares. <br> 
      THEN GitHub was being a pain in the ass and giving me fatal errors. <br>
      Convinced it’s because my laptop updated while Unity was running somehow. <br>
      And it messed with file locations or something because it was literally working just fine 2 days ago. <br>
      Whatever, it’s fully functioning now and I’ve learnt what to do if it happens again. <br>
      I also keep having synchronicity happening again. <br>
      I think of someone and they just text or snap message me within like a minute? <br>
      Crazy. Seems to only work with women though. <br>
      W rizz. <br>
      Maths we learnt about matrices, algebra and some more stuff I’ve already forgotten. <br>
      Nothing crazy exciting though it was new so there’s that. <br>
      We like a difficulty spike. I was with my usual friends, suffering together. <br>
      Programming nothing interesting happened. We have a presentation on the last day before Easter. <br>
      Maths lab session we just used Python to do maths for us. <br>
      Fun. I was with someone as normal, helping him and then him helping me because I can’t read apparently. <br>
      The weeks before any sort of break is mainly just “finishing assignments, then getting new one due in for May”. <br>
      Yep. Real fun. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 77: Talk XP Up </h1>
    <p>
      Pretty chill day. <br>
      Morning lecture is nothing crazy, though it’s super dead now. <br>
      Like less than 20 turned up…out of 120 students. I saw my friend on the train in the morning, we talked about cars. <br>
      He says he wants a BMW or something when he’s older so...hoping he doesn’t forget about indicators. <br>
      Then went with him to the touchdown cafe area and just continued with my coursework. <br>
      More specifically the reflection log. Which is basically just diary entries? But obviously more specific for the project. <br>
      I also had another yummy pizza roll, this one didn’t break my teeth or crunch super loud luckily. <br>
      Afternoon lab session was just Boolean algebra. It’s the easiest form of algebra ever. <br>
      Because the only answers you can get is 1 or 0. Beats doing line graphs and matrices and polynomials. <br>
      I also saw another one of my friends on the way home on the train. <br>
      He’s chill, we just talked about life and movies. <br>
      Pretty sure he was also in the foundation year “friend group” so they’re all friendly. <br>
      Maybe not the best mindset in terms of coursework. <br>
      I catch them playing Roblox whatever or Valorant instead of doing assignments but meh. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 78: Prototypes In Bio  </h1>
    <p>
      Well I intended to go into the library except…there was a massive graduation event going on. <br>
      Way too busy to be doing work. So I went somewhere else nice and quiet. <br>
      In the town centre there was also some international food event? <br> 
      Similar to what happened months ago. The food smelled really good…but seemed kinda expensive. <br>
      I had some McDonald’s instead. <br>
      Evening lab session not much exciting to talk about. <br>
      Group presentation next week. <br>
      Want to try and sort that out and as much of my group project as possible before Easter break. <br>
