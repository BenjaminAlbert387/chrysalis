    <h1> Day 26: Cat-Ears Cutie (30th October 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      So yeah I wore my cat ears today. <br>
      Very on theme for Halloween and very scary because I did not expect the amount of odd glares, whispering (I can still hear ya) and more. <br>
      But that won’t stop me. <br>
      Nothing interesting happened in either lecture so we’ll talk about the bits between. <br>
      Actually in the second lecture this girl was asking about my life so that was interesting, and she called me cute. <br>
      Which I just said "aww thanks". Think I fumbled there, I can't lie. <br>
      As I was walking out to get some Greggs (the nice cashier lady complimented me which was sweet) <br>
      I sensed this like group of guys in my computing class behind me. <br>
      It was kinda unnerving because I had no clue what they were doing. <br>
      Felt pretty vulnerable icl. Then one of them walks a bit forward, I glanced at him and he murmured “oh fuck”. <br>
      I can assume they thought I was a girl and wanted to rizz me up. <br>
      Now I know being a girl (or people thinking you are) in public sucks ass :P <br>
      Then I did a workshop of public speaking. It’s because the workshops this week are about “fears” coz Halloween. <br>
      But it was very interesting and I learnt a lot. <br>
      Like how in a lecture and the lecturer asks a question, you never move on and just wait it out. <br>
      Because the awkwardness of the class is gonna break first. <br>
      And how if you hold a water bottle in your hands you can essentially fiddle around with it. <br>
      Without looking like you’re fiddling around. <br>
      Then I saw my mates at the train station. One of them wanted to die at the sight of me (can’t blame her) <br>
      And the other one tried on the cat ears which was even funnier. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 27: My Name Is...? </h1>
    <p>
      Alright people, let’s start at the beginning one last time. <br>
      My name is Benjamin, and for the last 12 or so hours I’ve been the one and only Spider-Bwen. <br>
      I’ve been bitten by a radioactive- yeah you get the point. <br>
      So yeah I dressed up for Halloween. <br>
      Unsurprisingly, not many people did either. <br>
      I guess people are too old for Halloween smh. <br>
      But so many people were like smiling and laughing. <br>
      One kid on a bus even took a picture and I waved hi too. <br>
      I definitely made his day a million times better. <br>
      Lectures were just as usual to be honest. Nothing crazy happened in them. <br>
      I don’t think the lecturers knew who I was cosplaying as so that’s good I think. <br> 
      And yes, I still kept the cat ears on during lecture. <br>
      I also did some pumpkin carving, it was surprisingly easy. <br> 
      Painted on it too and yeah looks super dripped out in the student union. <br> 
      Coz there’s a storm with amber warnings I don’t know if I’m able to come in for the rest of the week. <br>
      But today I truly went out there and threw fear to one side. <br>
      (Ain’t that something.) <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 28: A Sign </h1>
    <p>
      Today starts like all the other Wednesday’s. <br>
      Get on the train and hear some school kids chat about someone’s mother. My friend looked even more tired than me tbh. <br>
      I get some coding done (All my assignments are submitted now!) <br>
      After the short 1 hour lecture (yep 1 hour is now short in my head) <br>
      I get lunch, go to the library to meet up with some people from my class. <br>
      I wouldn’t say friends just yet yknow? <br>
      But more than the random classmates I force myself to talk to. <br>
      But they’re nice in person. <br>
      Maybe not on Snapchat but meh, anyone can hide behind a screen. <br>
      Then interview time for a partner school ambassador. <br>
      It basically means you advertise the university. <br>
      And like I do that anyway on LinkedIn. <br>
      But you get to travel and that means I get to get out of lectures 🥶 (At least I hope.) <br>
      And it’s paid too. And CV experience I guess. <br>
      The interview went alright but only time will tell huh. <br>
      I couldn’t get course representative but maybe I’ll get this? <br> 
      If not then fuck, I can’t do anything right lmfao. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 29: Triple Threat </h1>
    <p>
      So I obviously didn’t come into university today. <br>
      Way too risky of something bad happening due to Murphy’s Law. <br>
      But I get up early anyways so if you’re thinking I was all cozy in my bed…you’re mistaken. <br>
      Not much happening today. <br>
      I did this Microsoft outlook workshop which was interesting. <br>
      once you do both parts you can take an exam and be officially qualified. For real. <br>
      Like Microsoft even send you a certificate and everything. <br>
      But I’ve got a while to go with that. <br>
      Then I attended some webinar for this company. <br>
      I mean it was alright, I didn’t fall asleep or anything. <br>
      But I can’t apply to anything because they require you to be on your second year of university. <br>
      It’s nice seeing options. And I need content on LinkedIn to write about. <br>
      I’m not posting dead memes on it just yet, mine are not office appropriate. 💀 <br>
      Then I logged into the online class session literally saying hi and marking my attendance. <br>
      I’ll do the work after I eat 🤷‍♂️ but I didn’t skip class. <br>
      So see, that proves I’m mature. <br>
