    <h1> 100 Days Since I Started Learning - February 4th 2024 </h1>
    <p>
      I guess this is a nice reflection from where I started. <br>
      Had a lesson today, and after a shaky start I got my ass into gear for a decent drive. <br>
      Instructor still had to use the dual controls a handful of times. <br>
      I was going a bit too quick when approaching roundabouts. <br>
      But by the end of the lesson I was doing them safely and at the appropriate speed. <br>
      Did the emergency stop procedure as well for the first time. <br>
      Nailed it twice in a row but I’m thinking that’s beginner’s luck tbh. <br>
      18 hours of driving lessons, approximately 12 hours of those behind the wheel. <br>
      Definitely making progress but I just need to get my head in the game from the moment I get behind the wheel. <br>
      Positioning is also SO much better, very rarely am I told to move to the right and it’s just very minor adjustments. <br>
      Still need to be aware of not hitting the kerb and pre emptive turning at junctions to go left. <br>
      It feels unnatural in a way, turning first then checking second but whatever. <br>
      I think it’s natural to think “why did I do that / why did I not do that” constantly and “I’m never gonna pass”. <br> 
      But we gotta keep going! 😊 <br>
      And remember why we are actually doing this. <br>
      And I’m binge watching driving videos instead of anime :P <br>
