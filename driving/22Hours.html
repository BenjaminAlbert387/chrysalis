    <h1> Torrential Rain </h1>
    <p>
      Not the most ideal conditions, but I’m not gonna let a good learning opportunity go to waste. <br>
      The rain didn’t affect me as much as I thought to be honest. <br>
      Also got be used to using the auxiliary system controls which is good. <br>
      Can’t exactly use the windscreen wipers on a clear sunny day. <br>
      Did a bit of everything. Stop start traffic, roundabouts, junctions, even the motorway for the first time! <br>
      Which was a bit scary going that fast. <br>
      It’s also so much harder to control the car, even adjusting by like a cm and the car has shifted position. <br>
      I still need to work on my forward bay parking. <br>
      I did it alright first time with no help. <br>
      The second time I did go a bit to the left. <br>
      Also gotta watch my speed and not accelerate too fast. <br>
      And finally the A word. Anticipation. <br>
      Definitely some moments where I would’ve failed the real thing. <br>
      I guess it’s better to make mistakes now. <br>
      Do it wrong the first time so you can do it right the next time. <br>
      Even saw a pretty rainbow during the drive back home. <br>
      Maybe it’s a sign :P <br>
