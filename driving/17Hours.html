    <h1> Speed Chaos </h1>
    <p>
      Had another lesson today. <br>
      Definitely more successful than my previous lesson, felt a lot better health wise and I coped good enough with the sun glare in my eyes. <br>
      Positioning was also better than my previous lesson but this isn’t about that. <br>
      I know that your attitude towards driving shouldn’t be “who’s to blame” but... <br>
      I don’t know if my instructor is being genuine with feedback or being genuinely picky. <br>
      I have a couple of examples below from today: <br>
      Clear road, 40mph limit. I decided to be at 38-39mph and they told me I’m going “far too slow”. <br>
      No one was even behind me, checked my mirrors and everything. <br>
      Roundabout, I approached it at ~13mph and it was clear, not even a single car or pedestrian but still told me to slow down. <br>
      This one I understand a bit more, so should I always just have my foot over the brake pedal preemptively when approaching? <br>
      Told me to “slow down a bit”, so I did using the brakes. <br>
      Then told me I slowed down too hard and instead to just lift my foot off the gas. <br>
      How was I supposed to know? <br>
      I still have a lot to learn, I guess. <br>
