    <h1> Nerves </h1>
    <p>
      Another week, another driving lesson. <br>
      I did another mock test and the nerves got to me so much. <br>
      I almost got too close to parked cars on the left (because there were oncoming cars and I couldn’t tell if I had enough space). <br> 
      But I realised and adjusted my position. Then parallel parking, I accidentally went full off too soon. <br>
      I did it perfectly twice right after, I knew what to do I just fumbled it. <br>
      Apart from those two problems, everything was fine otherwise. <br>
      Forward bay parking, done smoothly. <br>
      Reverse parking, one shot and done. (I was basically grinning with myself because I’d never thought I’d see the day.) <br>
      But let’s not get too cocky and overconfident. <br>
      Pull up on the right, sorted and with good observations too. <br>
      We practiced emergency stop, bonnet questions and all the auxiliary controls. <br>
      The only other stupid (and I mean very stupid) mistake I did was thinking I was on a mini roundabout. <br>
      When I was actually at a junction and therefore tried to turn right. <br>
      With a car oncoming. Not my finest moment. <br>
      After that though, no other issues on the drive. <br>
      All I gotta do for my safe driving assessment is drive legally, safely and confidently. <br>
      I’ve written down driving affirmations, study “the blade” aka YouTube videos, and not do something dumb. <br>
      It’s weird how I’ve said congratulations to so many people, all the advice I’ve received and given on the subreddit. <br>
      Every time I got downvoted to hell and definitely did not take it personally. Oops. <br>
      Whatever, I think I’m waffling. But it’s not over yet. <br>
      As for when it’s actually booked…you won’t know until it happens! <br>
      I haven’t told anyone, not even my parents. <br>
