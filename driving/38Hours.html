    <h1> Dread </h1>
    <p>
      I‚Äôm getting closer and closer to it. <br>
      I can almost taste it, but I still have some minor issues I need to sort out before then. <br>
      I was this close to nailing the reverse park perfectly, but I screwed up and accidentally went full lock right fully and yeah. <br>
      I got it second try though. Pull up on the right was done flawlessly, and I had some observations too. <br>
      Forward park I had to use a minor for (It was part of my mock test) but I got it in the bay. <br>
      Parallel park I just needed to straighten up the tires and it would have been golden. <br>
      Funnily enough I was in front of someone doing their actual driving assessment. <br>
      Hopefully they passed! <br>
      Someone cut right in front of me so hopefully the learner reacted in time. <br>
      My number one issue is approaching roundabouts. <br>
      I know you need to be in second gear / 20mph to be able to get onto them comfortably. <br>
      But my head sees ‚Äúempty on the right = okay to go faster‚Äù. <br>
      Didn‚Äôt get punished for it but my luck is gonna run out sooner or later. <br>
      Apart from that I‚Äôm starting to like driving a lot more than I did two months ago. <br>
      Everything is falling into place. <br>
      I know I‚Äôm gonna get some flak for learning automatic but... <br>
      I‚Äôm happy, confident and feel in control and that‚Äôs what matters most. <br>
      Sure, I might not be able to drive immediately after I pass but‚Ä¶I managed just fine for 19 years. <br>
      I think I can manage for a few months more. <br>
      Now that my second semester of university is wrapping up, it gives me time to focus up on my driving skills and earn some ü§ë. <br>
      And maybe some sleepless nights about how I suck and can‚Äôt drive and yeah... <br>
