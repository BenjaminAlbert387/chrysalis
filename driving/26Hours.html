    <h1> Parallel Universe </h1>
    <p>
      Finally got to use the satnav for the first time. <br>
      It’s not really that complicated though sometimes there’s a delay / lag for instructions. <br>
      I’d assume the examiner knows that and would tell me in advance. <br>
      Also getting into the habit of putting the car in neutral and handbrake up at traffic lights. <br>
      Just a small thing I guess but less strain on the gearbox is a good thing :P <br>
      Only small issue I had was parallel parking. <br>
      Think I was tired out at this point, as it was near the end of the lesson. <br>
      I tried it like 5 times. Only managed to do it once somewhat successfully. <br>
      I know exactly why though, it’s because I lift my foot off the brake when reversing for the 45 degree angle bit. <br>
      I’m supposed to lift it up just slightly... <br>
      I feel a bit stupid now because I only realised this a few hours after my lesson. <br>
      It only just clicked into my head “you’re using your brakes to control the speed for the manoeuvre”. <br>
      Just like how you reverse in or out of a parking spot, I guess. <br>
      It’s the hardest manoeuvre to do and also the least likely. <br>
      But my luck has high highs and low lows so I’m not taking any chances. <br> 
      I’m gonna learn it and be confident in doing it. <br>
      At least my forward bay parking was solid. <br>
      Coz if I get a “lucky” pass with a crap ton of minors I’m gonna doubt my driving ability even more. <br>
      And tbh more scared to drive in the real world with no help, instead of genuinely getting confident and safe. <br>
      I guess it’s a mindset thing? <br> 
      Some people would have a more genuine need for a car whereas for me it’s “just a freedom tool”. <br>
      Don’t exactly fancy driving in rush hour traffic, just to get to university. <br>
      I can just use the train. <br>
      26 hours of driving lessons. <br>
      Hopefully I'll be better at parallel parking soon! <br>
