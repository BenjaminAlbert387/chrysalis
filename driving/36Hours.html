    <h1> Mock Test 2 </h1>
    <p>
      Lot of good and lot of bad happened. <br>
      From the title you can see that I’ve done my second mock test and would have passed if I had the reverse park or pull up to the right. <br>
      Took me more than two tries for the forward bay park and parallel park but that’s why I’m learning. <br>
      Minors for: <br>
      1x Judgement (There was a gap I took I probably shouldn’t have) <br>
      1x Undue hesitation (Roundabout on a hill and I slowed down too hard when I could have gone) <br>
      2x Signals (Indicated right when I should’ve went left. Fixed it immediately after I realised but still. <br>
      Then forgot to indicate left when pulling over to the left. Least I didn’t bang the curb this time around.) <br>
      1x Progress (Was doing 30 in a 40. Need to have more practice with maintaining speed on steep hills) <br>
      1x Mirrors (Didn’t check them before braking at traffic lights) <br>
      But the worst thing was right before my lesson finished. <br>
      I cut someone off on a roundabout. Never done it before, normally my issue is hesitation but either because I was tired or whatever. <br>
      I just decided to go when the Tesla was very clearly NOT indicating left. Yeah. <br>
      Not doing that again because that was such a stupid mistake. <br>
      Luckily no one got hurt and I didn’t even get beeped at (surprisingly). <br>
      So I pretty much need to work on anticipating gaps and keep doing parking manoeuvres until they stick in my head. Damn. <br>
      I am hard on myself a bit but that’s because the examiners aren’t gonna be soft. <br>
      And not “oh well you almost got it” on the driving assessment. <br>
      I am capable, I just need to prove it yknow? <br>
      It feels like I’ve fixed one problem but then I’ve made two more mistakes I’ve never done before. <br>
      Kinda like coding. Part of the learning process I suppose. <br>
