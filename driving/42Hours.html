    <h1> Confidence </h1>
    <p>
      Been a while since I had a driving lesson but don’t worry, I haven’t just been playing video games. <br>
      Watching other driving instructors online, test routes and just trying to absorb as much knowledge as possible like a sponge. <br>
      Another mock test done, 4 minors this time which was technically worse than before but whatever. <br>
      Had to redo reverse parking, had the perfect starting position and everything but because it was raining... <br>
      I couldn’t see my blind spot mirrors as much so I was on the line. <br>
      Then for the pull up on the right I may have driven about 200 yards before deciding to stop. <br>
      I drive forward for a bit so the wheels are straight. <br>
      Observations were fine though… but yeah don’t drive on the wrong side of the road for ages. <br>
      Third minor was for lane discipline, I was getting a bit close to a car on the other lane. <br>
      (It was a very sharp turn so should’ve kept it more tight but I think it was just nerves.) <br>
      Final minor…I believe it was speed, my speedometer on the dashboard crept up to 32mph and my instructor is “worst case scenario” while doing routes. <br>
      Getting back was just constant traffic so we did every single tell me question. <br>
      Got most of them right first try but definitely need to go over them a bit. <br>
      Everyone asks when my driving assessment is and I give everyone the same answer of “Soon!”. <br>
      I feel like a game developer saying when updates are going to be happening. <br>
      Only two people in the entire world know, me and my instructor (Technically 3 if you’re counting the examiner) <br>
      Really glad I stuck with driving (even though I did switch to automatic) <br>
      Because six months ago I would have laughed at you if you said future me would be going on motorways, overtaking... <br>
      Doing parallel parking / reverse parking and being a bit more confident. <br>
      And yes, I talk to myself constantly throughout the mocks and will definitely do that on the actual driving assessment. <br>
      (Not because I like my own voice but because commentary driving is what makes me comfortable - if I say it I’ll do it yknow?) <br>
