    <h1> Mistake Master </h1>
    <p>
      Had a really good drive according to my driving instructor. <br>
      but dang I really make some of the most stupid mistakes and decisions ever… <br>
      Saw an oncoming car and there was easily enough time to get into a space, but I decided to go ahead. <br>
      Did that twice and both times I was like “why the hell did I do that then?!” <br>
      Such a dumb decision because every other time today I had good planning and pulled in when necessary. <br>
      Roundabouts I still need to get better at, by the end I was a bit more confident at taking opportunities but yeah. <br>
      Did every parking manoeuvre first time except the reverse park. Had to do that multiple times. <br>
      Eventually got it in but it was embarrassingly painful. <br>
      On the way back we were joining into a motorway…and I didn’t check my mirrors. <br>
      So the van had to slow down a bit. Think I was too focused on getting my speed up. <br>
      I completely missed to check them. But I won’t do that again. <br>
      I guess this is to say…messing up is the best teacher. <br>
      As long as you learn from it! <br>
      And that even if you’re nearing your driving assessment day, you are still going to be making mistakes and bad decisions. <br>
