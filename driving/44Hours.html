    <h1> Refreshed  </h1>
    <p>
      Had another lesson since I hadn’t driven in a while and I just wanted to be behind the wheel to be honest. <br>
      The drive was overall very smooth - the only issue I did was about 10 mins into my lesson. <br>
      There was a roundabout and I almost pulled out on someone as their road position was hard to see. <br>
      Apart from that I did all the parking manoeuvres first time, the mock test I did didn’t have any serious or dangerous faults. <br>
      Emergency stop I did well, and I also followed road signs. <br>
      I guess this post is to say keep going! <br>
      For people who are still learning, people who are doing refresher lessons, whatever it may be just know it will all be worth it. <br>
      Don’t take any risks or chances - multiple times throughout I held back or waited even if I “could have” gone and it wasn’t a minor. <br>
      I don’t know if you have to say it, but I also said out loud “I’m gonna wait until the X colour car has gone”. <br>
      Or “I’m giving way because I’m not fitting through that gap”. <br>
      I only do commentary driving when I absolutely need to, it’s just my personality. <br>
