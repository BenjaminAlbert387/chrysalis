    <h1> Speed Control </h1>
    <p>
      I don’t know if having a cold or taking paracetamol can affect your driving but I just feel annoyed at myself. <br>
      For context I’ve had 16 hours of driving lessons, 8 in manual and 8 in automatic. <br>
      (I didn’t want to continue learning manual for personal reasons) <br>
      In terms of “actually being behind the wheel” I’ve had 10 hours I suppose. <br>
      Today’s lesson I was just doing stupid mistakes 🙃 but my main issue is speed control. <br>
      I’d say 75-80% of the time I’m at an “acceptable speed”. <br>
      By that I mean my instructor isn’t telling me to go faster or slower. <br>
      Obviously not good enough. I also notice I put my foot off the gas pedal if my instructor is telling me something. <br>
      I don’t know how to fix this before it forms into a bad habit? <br>
      Big roundabouts I still struggle with. I brake early so that’s not an issue but when it’s time to go… <br>
      I don’t know how fast or slow I’m supposed to go? <br>
      My driving instructor said “fast” so I put my foot down but apparently that was too fast?! <br>
      I only think I got up to 19mph on that roundabout anyways. <br>
      But another similar roundabout I was doing 13mph and that was too slow so it’s a very fine balance. <br>
      Plus I feel like positioning of my car isn’t 100% there and it really should be by now I feel like. <br>
      I’m in the correct lane but I’m always told to go more left. <br>
      But it looks like I’m gonna clip the kerbside. (Though hitting the curb is better than hitting a car) <br>
      We’ve briefly done some manoeuvres like parking in a bay, reversing and three point turns but obviously still need work on those. <br>
      I am getting better with using my mirrors and observations accordingly to him which was nice to say. <br>
      I don’t know if you’re supposed to do this but as soon as he calls out an instruction I immediately check my centre and appropriate mirror, then signal. <br>
      Traffic as well I’m doing well with too; keeping a good distance behind cars, slowly creeping forward in traffic. <br>
      And checking mirrors constantly in case a motorist tries to overtake. <br> 
      I feel like I’ve regressed slightly in terms of overall skill but I don’t know if that’s a problem or just a “one off”. <br>
      I guess I just wanted to vent my thoughts and see if anyone else relates. 🤷‍♂️ <br>
