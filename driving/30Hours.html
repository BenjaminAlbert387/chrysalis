    <h1> Round And Round We Go </h1>
    <p>
      A lot to talk about this lesson! <br>
      Parking went well (forward bay and parallel parking) <br>
      Kinda well (pull up on the right) <br>
      And struggled (reverse parking) <br>
      Roundabouts I need to get more confidence with. <br>
      I’m missing even the easiest opportunities ever but I will get better with them eventually. I gotta. <br>
      The sat nav route we did was alright, meeting decisions were good. <br>
      No close calls or fighting with drivers. <br>
      Spot the danger, reduce the risk. Simple as that. <br>
      Also need to work on “nitpick things” as my driving instructor said. <br>
      Like getting an inch or two closer to the curb. I’m like…75% of the time I’m close enough to it. <br>
      Also going over the line for junctions (Not talking about peep and creep) <br>
      It happened twice. <br>
      Ironically my driving got better near the end of my lesson. <br>
      I guess I locked in or something? But I’m pretty tired now. <br>
      It’s just kinda frustrating because I know what to do, I know how to do it yet…can’t. <br>
      Progress is not linear, I keep telling myself but it doesn’t really help when ya know you can and have done better. <br>
      One day I’ll change my flair on Reddit to “Qualified Driver”, I know it. <br>
