    <h1> Day 57: Bunker Days (6th February 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Morning is every other typical morning. <br>
      Except I forget my lanyard which isn‚Äôt a total issue. <br>
      I just emailed attendance so they knew. <br>
      Not like it mattered in the end. <br>
      All I really did was do some prep watching about why humans suck with recycling tech. <br> 
      And we waste a lot of stuff because capitalism ü•∞. Fun. <br>
      Got Greggs then headed to my class. <br>
      Sike. Training for me. <br>
      Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs many more during my classes though so I can‚Äôt keep getting away with it. <br>
      But according to my friend it was shocking, dry and boring. <br>
      And I actually presented during the training session so go me. <br>
      Couldn‚Äôt escape my class right after‚Ä¶or could I? <br>
      Yes I could, the lecturer was over half an hour late. <br>
      To a lecture THAT WAS 90 MINUTES. <br>
      To be fair, most people waited but me and my mate couldn‚Äôt be asked. <br>
      So we dipped and not even 5 mins after the lecturer arrives. <br>
      Okay not my fault that time. Like was I supposed to wait that long? <br>
      We got KFC but we had to walk really far coz he ordered it to the wrong one. <br>
      Least I got my steps in. And I made it back for my other maths class. <br>
      Yep, no dodging this one. <br>
      It was pretty easy. Like GCSE Maths level easy so I flew past the questions. <br>
      And instead started doing notes on what I previously missed from early afternoon. <br>
      And we finally got our groups. I know exactly **one** person in said group. <br>
      And that was because I purely guessed his name by chance. <br>
      I would‚Äôve yknow like to meet my group but I couldn‚Äôt resist a spicy chicken wrap. <br>
      Oh well, I‚Äôll see em on Thursday. <br>
      And that‚Äôs when real despair starts?! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 58: Assess This  </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing interesting happened in the morning. <br>
      It was kinda depressing about e waste. <br>
      How we‚Äôre essentially killing children in Africa coz of capitalism and pressure. ü•∞ <br>
      And the media doesn‚Äôt care about it. <br>
      Then I went with my friend to Greggs and then Taco Bell coz he wanted a ‚Ä¶ taco. <br>
      Funny that. <br>
      After we ate we just chilled in the Touchdown Cafe area. <br>
      Well actually I was finishing off my notes for maths but yeah. <br>
      Then the practical part of the day. <br>
      We got our assignment quite early this time around which is good. <br>
      And I did some of it during said class because there‚Äôs not really much else at the moment. <br>
      My mate dipped after like two hours in which is fair enough, actually I‚Äôd say 90% of the class did. <br>
      I just stay coz I‚Äôm on my grindset era. <br>
      It‚Äôs ‚Äúgiving‚Äù academic weapon. <br>
      Pretty average day, really. <br>
      I bonded a bit closer with one of my group members though which was nice. <br>
      I know it‚Äôs a week until Valentine‚Äôs but... <br>
      Don‚Äôt even get your hopes up, people. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 59: Co-op Gaming  </h1>
    <p>
      Did some more assignment work in the morning. <br> 
      Saw my friends (always a big W) <br>
      And got me and one of them a lovely Greggs sausage roll. <br>
      Yummy. <br>
      One of my university friends also met up with one of my other friends for the first time. <br>
      My brain got totally fried. <br>
      I don‚Äôt like having to be ‚Äúin the middle‚Äù of two different friend groups. <br>
      But I know y‚Äôall not interested in that. <br>
      You want the juicy stuff‚Ä¶the group project from hell?! <br>
      I‚Äôm kidding it was alright. For a group of six only three people showed up. <br>
      One of them has a ‚Ä¶ weird smell? <br>
      I‚Äôm trying to be nice. <br>
      But he‚Äôs the extrovert of the group. <br>
      And needs to be tested. <br>
      Seriously, I‚Äôm not being mean for that, that‚Äôs a comment he said. <br>
      We‚Äôre gonna get on fine. As for the other guy, he‚Äôs chill. <br>
      Seems to be the introverted type. Or he doesn‚Äôt like group projects. <br>
      I don‚Äôt blame him. <br>
      We eventually decided on making a video game. <br>
      At least this week is over! <br>
