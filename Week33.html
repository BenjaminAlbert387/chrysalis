    <h1> Day 73: Turning Orange (12th March 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      I got randomly offered fruit in the morning when I was trying to do my work? <br>
      I assume itâ€™s the student union promoting healthy eating or something but that was weird. <br>
      I just did more coding for my group project in the morning. <br>
      While snacking on two oranges. <br>
      Maths time and it was coding Maths in Python. <br>
      Itâ€™s like the easiest programming language. 
      Which makes it convenient for mathematics people and data scientists. <br>
      Itâ€™s also surprisingly powerful but kinda annoying to set up. <br>
      Itâ€™s like if you had to install math updates every time you used the calculator on your phone. <br>
      Programming lecture legit nothing happened. <br>
      Like it lasted half an hour. <br>
      Apart from a few questions asked, it was basically just an info session. <br>
      Very awkward when the class just went silent for a bit. <br>
      It was a bit tense. <br>
      Evening maths lab session it was just doing what we did in the afternoon class for real. <br>
      I sat with some people, theyâ€™re in the same group for their group project. <br>
      If only I could join them. Iâ€™d be cooking so hard. <br>
      Whatever, sometimes you just have to play the cards youâ€™re dealt with. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 74: The Real Sim(s 4) Shady </h1>
    <p>
      I did a cosplay for university today. <br>
      Some people actually noticed which was funny. <br>
      Itâ€™s the same one I uploaded onto the â€˜gram. Anyways. <br>
      Morning session I just sat with my friends. <br>
      (One of them also took my space which is annoying but whatever Iâ€™m not fussed. Maybe a little.) <br>
      We did logic gates and wow thereâ€™s a lot more compared to BTEC Computing. <br>
      Afternoon break: I go with my friend to the Touchdown Cafe area. <br>
      I also finish off my maths assignment and get a pizza roll too. <br>
      It was kinda crunchy so I hope I didnâ€™t snap a tooth. <br>
      Tasted yummy though. <br>
      Then I saw one of my classmates, and I somehow got dragged into doing some mini interview thing with the university? <br>
      I donâ€™t know how. He recorded it of course and ew. <br>
      I look like such a dork. I might be photogenic but definitely not videogenic. <br>
      Afternoon lab session I just put what I learnt in the morning into practice. <br>
      Itâ€™s fun when you actually learn something new and not just go over things you did before. <br>
      (Which tbh has been more often than not) <br>
      I suppose itâ€™s how many first year students get complacent. <br>
      Itâ€™s why I do other things in my time at university. <br>
      To not get comfortable and cruise. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 75: Orange For Life </h1>
    <p>
      Unity is going well. I managed to get a dice roll working and the grid displaying as well. <br>
      Solid work if I do say so myself. I also got offered more fruit (again) so yeah exciting. <br>
      I also saw one of my friends, but not the regular squad. Kinda disappointing. <br>
      Another group session begins. <br>
      This time not only 4 people turned up, everyone contributed. <br>
      I might have been dreaming ðŸ¥¶. <br>
      I continued learning more stuff with Unity. <br>
      While everyone else got on with producing documentation. <br>
      Pretty productive day though nothing crazy exciting happened. <br>
      It does mean I got a lot of QA (Quality Assurance) to do. <br>
      Just so theyâ€™re not filled with spelling mistakes and typos. <br>
      Not to brag but like, kinda got that 8 in English for a reason y'know. <br>
