    <h1> Extra Stage 2: The APP </h1>
    <p>
      Instead of bed rotting watching YouTube videos and playing video games. <br>
      I decided to do something somewhat useful with my life on my Monday. <br>
      Garfield would not be proud. <br>
      Anyways I joined the APP Focus Group as Iâ€™m part of the SCE Ambassador team still and want to contribute somehow. <br>
      Also because I have really good ideas (totally). <br>
      Basically I got shown a bunch of data and how the university intends to spend their budget. Pretty interesting. <br>
      Some bits of data are surprising, like how ... I probably shouldn't say on the Internet. <br>
      After that we had a discussion. I say we but it was just me and another girl, and the lead for this program essentially. <br>
      It was enlightening to say the least. And I get paid for it too. Yay. <br>
