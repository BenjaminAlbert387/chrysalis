    <h1> Day 38: Pizza and Peace (20th November 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      The lectures were not important I can’t lie. <br>
      Everything interesting was after them. <br>
      I finally know the mysterious girl’s name. <br>
      Yknow the one that might have a crush on me? <br>
      Her name is [REDACTED]. <br>
      Anyways, I hung out with the uni group and they’re alright. <br>
      I don’t agree with their stance on rizzing up women but it could be worse. <br>
      Then I spoke to my friend for a bit. He got to try on my cat ear headphones. <br> 
      And they didn’t fit well. Probably because I bought a kids one. <br>
      I’m not spending £100 for an adult one. <br>
      After that I went and did the Enterprise Workshop. <br>
      They gave out free pizza and some loot. <br>
      I have so many tote bags now it’s kinda funny. <br> 
      Today was super productive which was nice. <br>
      Means I don’t have to grind as much during the week. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 39: Social Battery Low </h1>
    <p>
      So today I did a lot of walking and talking and I’m just very tired. <br>
      First workshop was fine. It’s easy so I showed off by using the special programming language we learnt recently. <br>
      And I even learnt how to do multiple flowcharts on it too. <br>
      Then I went out to eat at this Chinese place and luckily the chicken was good. <br>
      I paid for my friend, since he was too socially awkward to ask in English. <br>
      (Fair enough, he’s an international student.) <br>
      I was with the usual suspects since we were bored and didn’t know how to kill the next two hours. <br>
      Except I did. Someone asked me to help her with coding. <br>
      (Why me and not the people who have actually developed video games) <br>
      I dragged my friend along since I wasn’t gonna ditch him with the rest. <br>
      Someone else joined, and so did her friend so it was a big study group of 5. <br> 
      Fun. <br>
      Then the other lecture but it was pretty chill. <br>
      I’m glad I got some friends :) <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 40: I Did Stuff? </h1>
    <p>
      Really nothing interesting happened today. <br>
      I fixed my code I’ve been moaning about for a few weeks now. <br>
      Through the power of Nightcore music and self reflection. <br>
      Then I worked on my other assignment which is almost done. <br>
      I might have to help someone with theirs a little bit, which is fine. <br>
      I like helping others. <br>
      Shows that you understand what the heck you’re doing. <br>
      Then I attended the only lecture today and the numbers keep getting lower. <br>
      At least I saw my friend today. <br>
      Then I went to the Home Office Workshop. <br>
      No free food sadly so I had to get my own Greggs. <br>
      It was pretty interesting! <br>
      Working for the government doesn’t sound as depressing as I thought. <br>
      Also the job security. If they gotta get rid of the people running the country... <br>
      Then something catastrophic has happened. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 41: Fortnite: University Royale?! </h1>
    <p>
      Nothing interesting happened until after me and the squad had some McDonald’s. <br>
      We went to someone’s student accommodation. <br> 
      And wow they’re tiny. <br>
      Like my room is not much smaller than it. <br>
      Anyways, we watched some Korean show about these three failures in life who wake up with a baby that isn’t any of theirs. <br>
      Then we played mortal kombat 11 and I got destroyed. <br>
      I kept getting stun locked by a bitch with a blade. <br>
      Then we played Fortnite. Everyone did shit until my turn. <br>
      I got 13 kills, Zero Build then died and came 4th because a tree ate my bullets. <br>
      The scoped AR is so juicy. <br>
      Workshop time, coding is really fun and dumb. <br>
      If that wasn’t obvious already. <br>
      Then I helped someone (The Ultimate Coder - not a Danganronpa reference) with Maths. <br>
      For some reason he wants to get ahead, and since at that point I was the person with the most math skills I helped with probability. <br>
      Yknow the easiest damn topic in statistics. He seemed to like it and it’s extra revision for me. <br>
      My past really haunts me, huh? <br>
