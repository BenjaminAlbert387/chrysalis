    <h2> Academic Development Week </h2>
    
    <h1> Day 22 - Cover Letters and Code (23rd October 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      So it’s Academic Development Week. <br>
      Most people would just stay at home and fuck around. <br>
      But I’m not most people. <br>
      Besides, I know I’d be playing Spider-Man 2 instead of doing something productive. <br>
      Apart from getting Greggs at lunch I was in the library the whole time. <br>
      It’s super dead, I mean it normally is anyway but yeah. <br>
      I was just mainly completing CSS courses since I kinda need to know that for my degree. <br>
      I also added lots of people onto my LinkedIn, at least some people were nice to say thanks! <br>
      Who knew university gave me this much confidence? <br>
      I guess when you have nothing to lose you can become a menace. <br>
      Then I joined this workshop to learn more about CVs and Cover Letters. <br>
      I thought cover letters were pointless but turns out they aren’t. <br>
      But once again I was the only guy there. Ah well. <br>
      Though I should actually book it my attendance since tbh I thought it was a walk in. <br>
      I’ll remember for the rest of the week. <br>
      Also some guy has proper kicked off at the station because he bought a train ticket and they don’t think he’s under 16. <br>
      Though like, how can you prove you’re under 16? <br>
      I guess a passport but like just because you look old doesn’t mean you can assume. <br>
      And my guy brought a ticket too 😭 <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 23: Job Hunting and Train Hunting </h1>
    <p>
      I finished off my CV! <br>
      My fancy coding one with pretty colours and emojis and not for professional use. <br>
      And did some more coding too, I’m slowly starting to like it. <br>
      But I rather not code for my whole life. Makes my eyes go funny. <br>
      And the only thing that should be funny is me. <br>
      Then workshop about job hunting. <br>
      Sadly rattling off applications like a souped up SMG is not effective. <br>
      You gotta pick your job carefully and research (scary!) <br>
      But I learned about stuff I didn’t know before so that’s cool. <br>
      And you can post about “webinars” and other online events on LinkedIn (I didn’t know) <br>
      But you gotta have a “call to action”. <br>
      I’ll learn more on Thursday, that’s if I can even get in on that day. <br>
      Now I’m just waiting to get the hell back. <br>
      Gonna be a nightmare since there’s a fatality on the train line. <br>
      So there’s like at least 15 of us waiting for a replacement bus service. <br>
      Hopefully stars align and I get a train back to...home. <br>
      I wish I brought like spare clothes with me coz I might’ve been able to sweet talk someone into staying at theirs for a night. <br>
      Actually idk if I know anyone close enough for that so whatever. Canon event innit. <br>
      Edit: Okay looks like they managed to get the train sorted! Straight shot home, talk about clutch. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 24: Jargon, Be Gone (Thot) </h1>
    <p>
      Pretty chill day tbh. <br>
      Just working on my website and doing courses. <br>
      This is too much freedom for my lil brain. <br>
      At least I forced myself to get to Canterbury because I really didn’t want to be stuck in the house. <br>
      Especially with my brother playing Fortnite and yelling at his teammates. <br>
      Tomorrow I’m finalising two coursework bits for realsies so that’s fun. <br>
      They’re not due in until next week but like I’d like to do it and forget about it. <br>
      Then workshop time, or at least half of it. <br>
      Had to leave early because I’m gonna watch Five Nights At Freddy's with a friend. <br>
      But it was interesting and they email us the slides afterwards. <br>
      So I can look back on it…when I’m not tired. <br>
      Lol. It was about the jargon job recruiters use. <br>
      Apparently the only reason they do it is because…to keep within a word count? <br>
      And because some words are “known” in industry. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 25: End of Academic Development Week </h1>
    <p>
      I have things to be doing on Friday so I guess today is the final workshop for this week. <br>
      They’ve been massively helpful, especially considering part of our assignment is to do a “professional LinkedIn profile”. <br>
      We’ve been taught sweet fuck all about it. <br>
      I guess that’s university, figuring how stuff goes but whatever. <br>
      I’d rather know now and like not have to panic about it third year. <br>
      Which is all too common. <br>
      I’m totally #notliketheotherguys. <br>
      It was about job searching and internet stalking companies on LinkedIn. <br>
      A lot of “can and cannots” on that website. But hey knowing is half the battle or something. <br>
      Next week it’s back to normal timetables…but obviously I’m gonna dress up for Halloween. <br>
      Like I got my costume lined up and everything. It’s gonna be peak. 😼 <br>
