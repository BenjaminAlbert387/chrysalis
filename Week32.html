    <h1> Day 70: Not Lacking Critical Information (5th March 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      All I did this morning was more Unity coding and started the design documentation for the group project of despair. <br>
      I mean fun. Group projects are super fun. <br>
      Then we had maths and that’s just a blur at this point. <br>
      I have to take notes else I’d legit zone out and sleep. <br>
      We did critical path analysis, basically a fancy way of saying what tasks are time critical. <br> 
      And what tasks can you procrastinate on in a project. <br>
      Programming was pretty quick. There’s no lecture for it now it’s essentially a group meeting. <br>
      Or would be if other people turned up. Just me and one other person. <br>
      I get to know a bit more about him each day. <br>
      Good thing I didn’t study psychology else I’d turn feelings into a weapon 😵‍💫. <br>
      I’d be gaslighting everyone for real. <br>
      The maths lab session was fine. I actually know how to do tasks for our assignment now instead. <br> 
      And they fucking drew the image wrong so I have to redo a question before it’s due. <br>
      Amazeballs. Also one of our previous semester lectures came in like an MCU cameo that was funny. <br>
      At the point there were probably 5 people in the classroom so if he wanted a meet and greet he’s very mistaken. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 71: I Have A (Really Good) Excuse </h1>
    <p>
      Woke up in the morning feelin’ like…normal. <br>
      I actually sat behind a friend on the train ride to university, but I didn’t want to disturb his anime show. <br>
      I did send a snap to him, so he eventually turned around and saw me. Fun conversation. <br>
      Morning nothing particularly interesting or unusual happened. <br>
      Normally I’d have a break but... <br>
      I had to do the afternoon lab session work during it because I wasn’t gonna be in for it. <br>
      Because I was doing something else a bit more important. <br>
      Assessment centre practice! I’ve never done one before and it was super informative. <br>
      Sure, I would’ve technically “failed” on it overall. <br>
      Because for the first part I had to turn the page and it had the classic “Only answer questions 1, 2 and 3”. <br>
      And on the second part my brain went mush and forgot that “don’t touch the Lego until your group is ready” meant to wait. <br>
      the pressure got to me. And it wasn’t even a real assessment centre! Just a mock. <br>
      I got some quite valuable advice on my interview skills as well which was very helpful. <br>
      I guess I’ve learnt: <br>
      - Read the instructions on both sides of the paper. <br>
      - Take time for instructions to sink in a click first, even if there is a time limit it shouldn’t get to ya. <br>
      - Learn some good ways to finish a response instead of “uh yeah that’s it really” <br>
      - Answer the interview questions specifically. <br>
      - When you ask an interview question, give a response back to the question as confirmation. <br>
      Basically show them that you actually care not just you like saw “what to ask in an interview” on Google an hour before. <br>
      But it was super helpful and well, I’ve already done the lab session during the lunch break. <br>
      So no need to worry about catching up! 🙂 <br>

    <h1> Day 72: Yellow Cards, Locked and Loaded  </h1>
    <p>
      I haven’t became a footballer don’t worry. <br>
      They don’t let cute people play the beautiful game. <br>
      In the morning the only interesting thing that happens is that I see two of my friends. <br>
      I was trying to code in Unity without following a tutorial but it didn’t go well...Awesome. <br>
      Afternoon lab session and it’s the same old. <br>
      Half my group actually turned up this time, though it may as well have been nothing. <br>
      One was on his phone and the other person was doing maths coursework. In a programming class. <br> 
      Why did I get put up with the lazy bones. Hell, we even got a new member to our group but she didn’t even turn up. <br>
      With one person still sick and the other person dropping out of university entirely... <br>
      This group project is swimming up Shit's Creek without a paddle. <br>
      But I won’t back down. This is my moment to break though. Or something like that. <br>
      Really inspiring stuff. <br>
      If people aren’t showing up by next week I’m gonna yellow card them. <br> 
      Which basically means they’re not a part of the group. <br>
      Red card is for blatant misconduct like throwing hands. <br>
      Which, while funny, is extremely unlikely. <br>
