    <h1> Day 46: Debating and Hating (4th December 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      Not much happened in the morning, but I did see two friends which is nice. <br>
      Then I went to the Touchdown cafe area to try and find my group for the group debate. <br>
      I instead got roped in into helping this lady find her classroom and meeting another group instead. <br>
      I also waved hi to someone else, since I only just recognised her right when I was leaving. <br>
      Besides she was preoccupied with a video call with someone. She’s cool. <br>
      Anyways the group debate went without any major issues. <br>
      Luckily I didn’t need to remember my lines but even so. <br>
      I read and speak almost in two separate speeds so I almost tripped up a few times. <br>
      But it was alright and stepping up to be leader was a unique experience. <br>
      Then I painted a nutcracker at the first Christmas event this week. <br>
      Helped my mate some more with his Assignment 2. <br>
      And rocked my Christmas cat ears. <br>
      I am so “kawaii”. But Maddy didn’t think so...her loss :P <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 47: The Amazing Gingerbread Man </h1>
    <p>
      Okay, the morning lecture was kinda cool. <br>
      There’s this thing called a micro bit and you can basically program it to do … <br>
      Anything! That can be done in a 5x5 LED grid. <br>
      There’s some sensors and buttons too but actually seeing something you coded IRL is cool. <br>
      I managed to make a timing based game. <br>
      Where you have to time a button press to get a point but you only get one life. <br>
      And made the Fortnite default dance music by learning piano sheets? (It plays music) <br>
      Afternoon I was with my friend right after my PAT meeting. <br>
      It was just coincidence he was there talking to his bestie from abroad. <br>
      Then we decorated gingerbread men, I made mine spiderman kinda? <br>
      It’s hard to use the icing things because they were small and finicky. <br> 
      But it tasted good so whatever. <br>
      Then afternoon lecture but that was just revision for our upcoming exam. <br>
      Boring shit really. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 48: More Remote Learning  </h1>
    <p>
      Short one since it’s remote, nothing interesting happened. <br>
      But I did get to talk to a friend because we somehow got into the same random group. <br>
      We got lucky I guess. Only 20 people joined the online class and I doubt much more joined in person. <br>
      Really feeling like the first semester is over. It went by so quickly. <br>
      I also need to start putting these online with some minor edits (like not using people’s names) <br>
      But I’ll do that when we’re actually on break. <br>
      (Future me here, this was actually put online six months later. Oof) <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 49: Touring And Forming </h1>
    <p>
      I had campus tour training in the morning and it was fine. <br>
      I don’t think I’ll be doing any soon though because: <br>
      a) it’s the end of the semester and <br>
      b) they all take place during my classes. <br>
      Oh well it was fun, walking around places in campus I didn’t know existed. <br>
      And I get paid for it. <br>
      Then I got Greggs and did some more coursework. <br>
      It’s pretty much done but I like to add some finishing touches. <br>
      Then we learnt Microsoft Forms. <br>
      Or rather I self taught myself since today was just a catch up lesson. <br>
      It’s more graphical based which is good and pretty but coding it is even harder. <br>
      But I managed to get some of a calculator working. <br>
      And by some I mean…it can do add and subtract and clear the screen. <br>
      Luckily because the user can’t input anything they can’t make the program crash. <br>
      And die faster than a Fortnite noob in a build fight. <br>
