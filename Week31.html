    <h1> Day 66: Got Me Trippin’ (26th February 2024)  </h1>
    <p>
      Well a landslide ruined my original plans as half the trains got cancelled. <br>
      I only found out right when I needed to buy a ticket. <br>
      Oh well… I bought a Greggs sausage roll in the morning as today is a computing trip. <br>
      And a USB-C cable from Poundland since I know Anthony is gonna want one soon. <br>
      I’ll be like “well funny that I have one”. <br>
      I managed to speed run getting to university. <br>
      A 20 minute walk took me like 12. <br>
      I’m like Sonic The Hedgehog, but cuter. <br>
      We went to a Holiday Extras campus first. <br>
      It’s nothing like a normal office. <br>
      All open plan and there’s games rooms and even outdoor swimming pools for summer. <br>
      Then we stopped at this rest stop for lunch, I had some KFC because I wanted to and it was pretty good. <br>
      The rest stop also had a freaking arcade and gambling area! Fun. <br>
      Though I obviously didn't go in. <br>
      Then we went to Manston Airport. <br>
      It’s a semi abandoned airport but they’re trying to get it renovated and fixed up. <br>
      We literally got chauffeured around on the coach and had a tour around the place. <br>
      Runways, air traffic control towers and radar systems galore. <br>
      Then we went into the hanger where they assemble multi million dollar helicopters and it was so cool. <br>
      After a presentation and biscuits we said our goodbyes and we headed back. <br>
      The train back home got delayed too, but oh well. <br>
      Who knew a Monday could be this fun?! <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 67: Meeting And Greeting </h1>
    <p>
      I decided to stay at home today since the train situation is pretty bad. <br>
      And Anthony is sick so I’m gonna have to play nurse for a bit. <br>
      By that I mean essentially be his servant. <br>
      Least he won’t be screaming down any mics for the time being. <br>
      I did some productive things. Set up a group meeting and took down some minutes. <br>
      They’re essentially notes for what you did in a meeting,  
      But like formal and professional and in a business environment. <br>
      Someone probably knows what I’m on about. <br>
      Then I joined the only online session today and typed out a few questions. <br>
      I did enough talking in the meeting to be honest. <br>
      Sometimes ya gotta ass kiss your way into university life. <br>
      Or the nicer more positive way is “being open minded and saying yes to everything”. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 68: Unity and Me </h1>
    <p>
      I actually showed up on campus this time around. <br> 
      There was a workshop for one of our assignments and while there’s still definitely improvements needed. <br>
      It’s a “very impressive start” for my essay. <br>
      He could’ve probably done a better feedback burger but whatever. <br>
      Sometimes you gotta say it how it is. Also fun fact, you’re supposed to used the Justify text thing in word for essays. <br>
      I didn’t actually see the point of it but it makes all your text aligned and professional. <br>
      Why I’ve never been taught that ever, I don’t know. <br>
      Then I continued learning Unity. It’s a game engine where you make video games. <br>
      I didn’t expect to be using it this early but... <br>
      You gotta just take the plunge and learn quick. <br>
      I spend hours trying to re add a background tile because I didn’t understand what a palette was. <br>
      Sorry art people, I have sinned. <br>
      Finally did another workshop with the Careers team. <br>
      It was kinda interesting I guess? <br>
      I’m kinda suffering from a cold so not really in an amazing mindset. <br>
      I need my bed, my phone and a girl in said bed. Right now. 🙂 <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 69: Yeah, I’m Fit ;) </h1>
    <p>
      Like Wii Fit. The video game. <br>
      With the balance board and yeah you get where I’m going with this right? <br>
      Got in, did some rewriting for my essay assignment and then did some more coding in Unity. <br>
      I’m slowly starting to like it. Baby steps. <br>
      Then I continued helping out with the StressLess Wii project. <br>
      I did manage to test all the games and only two of the disks didn’t work which was impressive. <br>
      I just have to complete the spreadsheet and yeah it was pretty fun playing video games in university for the greater good. <br>
      The Wii Fit game is really mean, it said I was 42. <br>
      It’s coz the balance board is old and that’s what I’m blaming, not my balance. <br>
      Another month of the year done. <br>
      January dragged on like hell but February went pretty quick. <br>
