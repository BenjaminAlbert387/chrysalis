    <h1> Day 85: I’m So #random (23rd April 2024) </h1>
    <p>
      Well I started doing the maths assignment. It’s honestly easier than it looks. <br>
      A little bit. Oh well. Least I’ve done that. <br>
      The rest of the day was just learning about discrete probability, random number generation and how you can code it in Python. <br>
      It’s super obvious how we’re “at the sharp end” of the year as people are just not coming in. <br>
      But I am. May as well put that student loan into good use, right? <br>
      Oh, and somehow people’s timetables were STILL incorrect. <br>
      After all this time, seriously?! <br>
      Said we was in one room, but actually a completely different building. <br>
      Nice. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 86: Unmasked </h1>
    <p>
      We did fun stuff involving internet addresses, packet sniffing and masking your IP address. <br> 
      So you don’t get randoms on your local network. <br>
      The rest of the day was just me doing the second maths assignment. <br>
      It’s so long and hard...;) <br>
      Yeah. <br>
      I had a bacon and cheese turn over wrap. <br> 
      That was nice and different, makes for a change. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 87: Done, For Real? </h1>
    <p>
      This morning all I did was my second maths assignment and spoke to my friend for a bit. <br>
      Makes my head hurt, too many numbers and weird squiggly lines and subscripts. <br>
      (That’s the proper name for those tiny numbers) <br>
      Then afternoon session I was just finishing off my group project report that I was alone for YET AGAIN. <br>
      Two weeks in a row on my own is kinda tragic. Someone randomly called me which was...odd. <br>
      Luckily my lecturers don’t care at this point and pretty much let people get away with anything. <br>
      Listening to music, randomly helping other people with unrelated assignments. I’m a rebel. 🤷‍♂️ <br>
      The project report is finished. Now I just gotta get the other group members to read over it. <br>
      Make sure they’re happy before I press Submit. <br>
      This time next week I won’t even be in class, because the deadline for everything is at 2pm. <br>
      No point going to a class when you’ve literally done all the content. <br>
      (Okay there’s technically a reflective log, but that’s basically a diary. Something I already do!) <br>
