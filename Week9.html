    <h1>Day 6: It Was And Wasn't Me (September 25th 2023)</h1>
    <p>
      How ironic that once again I was late. <br>
      But this time wasn’t coz of me, there was a signal fault which had a domino effect of fucking everything else up. <br>
      I know quite a few people in my class that get the train but they either got in super early or didn’t show up. Oh well. <br>
      After my two Greggs sausage rolls I went back again and this time actually looked through the door first before walking in. <br>
      I know what room I gotta go to jeez, I did a lot of exploring on freshers week. And not a lot of friend making clearly but whatever. <br>
      The module leader for ethics is unsurprisingly really nice. <br>
      And the assignments aren’t too bad, combined they have less words than my EPQ. <br>
      But I’ll definitely get started today and get the creative juices flowing. And the other kind of juice if yknow what I mean. <br>
      Then I went to the library to pick up my prize. <br>
      Somehow I actually won, or they just wanted to pick the only guy that went to the StressLess event. <br>
      Whatever I’m not complaining about free shit. <br>
      They were gonna take a picture but they seemed hella busy with international students. Yknow, not getting deported so whatever not a big deal. <br>
      I’ll do my own selfie though and just tag them. Also then it gives me a chance to use filters :P <br>
      There’s seemingly no events that are interesting to me (I don’t care about tea) <br>
      I guess for now I’m going home when lectures end. <br>
      There are LinkedIn workshops which sound good though coz mine is so fucking dead and dry. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Day 7: Love Sick, Flu Sick, Well Sick</h1>
    <p>
      Today starts off as usual, walking around for a bit. <br>
      Gotta get my cardio up yknow? <br>
      Anyway I do my workshop and get lunch. At McDonald’s because I can. <br>
      Ever heard of synchronicity? It’s when you think of someone and they suddenly message you. <br>
      It only happens when I think of the ladies I can’t lie but I digress. <br>
      So I’m chilling at McDonald’s by my own as per usual and you never guess who walks in. <br>
      Actually you will have to guess. No names here, remember? <br>
      Then I’m back on campus for my other class. <br>
      I like to sit at the very front for a few reasons: I can see better, I’m smaller than 90% of my classmates. <br>
      The lecturers also like people who sit at the front. For real. <br>
      After that is home time obviously. <br>
      They gotta make the train announcements more clear. <br>
      Everyone was confused when it only mentioned two train calling points instead of the usual ten. <br>
      I could’ve sat next to people from class, but a ton of other computing students got the flu. <br>
      Explains why half of them don’t show up I suppose. <br>
      I’d rather not catch it either, my immune system is already shit as it is. <br>
      Anyways I got a new person added on my phone. He’s also super smart and he commutes too! <br>
      So that’s good to know. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Day 8: Music In An Introvert’s Paradise</h1>
    <p>
      Usually I walk around for a bit before lectures but this time I didn’t. <br>
      I’m not lazy but I needed to refresh myself on coding since I haven’t had to do that in…over a year. <br>
      I went to the library and wow it’s even bigger than previously I swear. <br>
      Anyway they have these different zones. <br>
      I decided to go in the quiet zone because I still wanted to listen to music. <br>
      And silently sing to myself. I’m like an amazing singer in my head trust me. <br>
      After that I went to my only lecture for today. <br>
      I met (re-met?) someone, good thing he recognises me “all the time” since I am useless with putting names to faces. <br>
      Maybe I’m that recognisable coz there’s not many mixed race people in my class, and definitely none as cute as me :) <br>
      I also saw one of my mates, he was just asking how university was going so far and stuff like that. <br>
      Then he said something that stuck with me. <br>
      “New people in every class? That’s hilarious, just you wait a few weeks then see who’s left.” <br>
      He’s got a point, I’ve been so focused, so tunnel visioned in trying to fit in... <br>
      I completely forgot the fact that I might never see half the class again if they drop out for whatever reason. <br>
      (Not like I see half the class anyway coz barely anyone turns up but that’s beside the point) <br>
      So now I’m trying to learn the names and faces of people who consistently turn up. I already know a few anyway... <br>
      Having our lecture end at half past the hour is very awkward. <br>
      Since while it is possible to catch the train for quarter to, you gotta sprint and that’s not really worth the effort. <br>
      So I went with a classmate and walked around for a bit, we surprisingly have a lot in common. <br>
      I’m just glad I actually get to talk to someone. I’m an introvert not someone in a recluse :P <br>
      I do want communication sometimes. <br>
    </p>

    <h1>Day 9: Late Nights, Lies and The Rizzless</h1>
    <p>
      What a fucking day it has been. <br>
      I do some coursework in the library, get some lunch from Pret A Manger and go back to campus. <br>
      Nothing particularly interesting. So I thought. <br>
      For whatever reason, the university messed up our timetables. <br>
      Instead of saying 4 to 7 it instead said 14 to 17. <br>
      So the 8 of us came in super early for no reason and no fault of our own. <br>
      I decided to tag along with some others because I legit knew no one else. <br>
      I wasn’t gonna sit around for hours. <br>
      We went to town and then to the cathedral. <br>
      It’s free for students and proper fancy. <br>
      Just walking through it makes you feel like some holy spiritual energy is in your body. <br>
      We then went to the fancy designer shops and everything is expensive as hell obviously. <br>
      There’s this super cute necklace but obviously not buying that since it was all gold… <br>
      After we left a classmate saw this girl in our class (I didn’t even know she was) <br>
      Tried to rizz her up. She clearly looked uncomfortable. <br>
      I blurted out “stop it you creep”. <br>
      I knew I was a feminist but I didn’t know I had it in me to say it out loud. <br>
      She stood next to me at the pedestrian crossing looking a bit more relieved I think? <br>
      Definitely wasn’t the time to ask so I left it. <br>
      Me and the group group then played some pool (still bad at it although I managed to pot some balls this time) before going to the lecture for real. <br>
      Most people actually turned up this time, probably because it was in the afternoon. <br>
      But as time went on more and more people started going. <br>
      Especially the people who got misled with the timetable confusion. <br>
      By the end it was just me and two other lads, and as a reward we got to choose a duck. <br>
      It’s a programming thing to have a duck to talk to. <br>
      I originally chose blue but eventually switched to a pink one to be different. <br>
      Also because it has lipstick and that’s funny. <br>
      The train back was fine. <br>
      The connection luckily got delayed but in the future I’ll probably have to wait for the later one. <br>
    </p>

    <p>And that ends Week 9!</p>
