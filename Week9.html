    <h1>Day 6: It Was And Wasn't Me (September 25th 2023)</h1>
    <p>
      How ironic that once again I was late. 
      But this time wasn’t coz of me, there was a signal fault which had a domino effect of fucking everything else up. 
      I know quite a few people in my class that get the train but they either got in super early or didn’t show up. Oh well. 
      After my two Greggs sausage rolls I went back again and this time actually looked through the door first before walking in. 
      I know what room I gotta go to jeez, I did a lot of exploring on freshers week. And not a lot of friend making clearly but whatever.
      The module leader for ethics is unsurprisingly really nice. 
      And the assignments aren’t too bad, combined they have less words than my EPQ. 
      But I’ll definitely get started today and get the creative juices flowing. And the other kind of juice if yknow what I mean…
      Then I went to the library to pick up my prize. 
      Somehow I actually won, or they just wanted to pick the only guy that went to the StressLess event. 
      Whatever I’m not complaining about free shit. 
      They were gonna take a picture but they seemed hella busy with international students. Yknow, not getting deported so whatever not a big deal. 
      I’ll do my own selfie though and just tag them. Also then it gives me a chance to use filters :P
      There’s seemingly no events that are interesting to me (I don’t care about tea)
      I guess for now I’m going home when lectures end. 
      There are LinkedIn workshops which sound good though coz mine is so fucking dead and dry.
    </p>

    <h1>Day 7: Love Sick, Flu Sick, Well Sick</h1>
    <p>
      Today starts off as usual, walking around for a bit. 
      Gotta get my cardio up yknow? 
      Anyway I do my workshop and get lunch. At McDonald’s because I can. 
      Ever heard of synchronicity? It’s when you think of someone and they suddenly message you. 
      It only happens when I think of the ladies I can’t lie but I digress. 
      So I’m chilling at McDonald’s by my own as per usual and you never guess who walks in. 
      Actually you will have to guess. No names here, remember?
      Then I’m back on campus for my other class. 
      I like to sit at the very front for a few reasons: I can see better, I’m smaller than 90% of my classmates.
      The lecturers also like people who sit at the front. For real. 
      After that is home time obviously. 
      They gotta make the train announcements more clear.
      Everyone was confused when it only mentioned two train calling points instead of the usual ten. 
      I could’ve sat next to people from class, but a ton of other computing students got the flu. 
      Explains why half of them don’t show up I suppose. 
      I’d rather not catch it either, my immune system is already shit as it is.
      Anyways I got a new person added on my phone. He’s also super smart and he commutes too! 
      So that’s good to know.
