    <h1> Day 34: Dead To Me (13th November 2023) </h1>
    <p>
      So our lecture was actually online. <br>
      But the Timetable has both online and offline classes. <br>
      I was very confused and went in anyway. <br>
      There was like one student in there? <br>
      I didn’t want to scare him or anything, so I just sat down in the cafe area and did my online lecture there. <br>
      Then I got Greggs as usual. <br>
      There should definitely be like a loyalty program or something. <br>
      (Actually maybe not, if there was I’d be going there more often 💀) <br>
      After some walking around to look at the store displays (some of them already have Christmas decorations) <br>
      I went back to campus and do my lectures. Which was actually in person this time. <br>
      It was so dry (and dead too, I’d say only a third of people showed up) <br>
      I had to find some memes to not fall asleep. <br>
      I found them hilarious. But my group didn’t which is a shame. <br>
      Anyway the second part was the group talking bit, which to be honest not much needed to be done. <br>
      I just mainly have to learn my lines. But then the lecturer left half an hour early. <br>
      I was like “well I’m not getting this train until I hightail it to hell” so I just did some more work until 2pm. <br>
      I legit haven’t seen half my group members so I don’t know if they’re dead or like not on the course anymore? <br>
      As an act of defiance I put their roles as “dead / MIA”. <br>
      I’m really funny. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 35: Social Skillz </h1>
    <p>
      Don’t you hate it when you lose a really nice pen and you gotta dig out a reserve pen from the depths of...your pencil case. <br>
      I’m actually gutted because it was a really nice pen too, one of those multi coloured ones. <br>
      But yeah that’s how my morning went. <br>
      I think the lecturers and classmates are starting to warm up to me. <br>
      More of them know my name than I remember theirs. <br>
      maybe that’s because my name is awesome and amazing. <br>
      And probably because I participate in class. <br>
      I tried to find a similar pen in Poundland but nothing. <br>
      So I went to Greggs instead to cheer myself up. <br>
      The group members actually turned up. <br>
      Or at least some of them did. <br>
      Our presentation is pretty much sorted, just got the final touches and references to do. <br>
      Then my other lecture today. Some girl sat directly behind me and I don’t know why. <br>
      I didn’t ask for her name but I was too cold / wet / tired to be asking questions. <br>
      What game is she playing? What is her MO? <br>
      Coz she has never sat behind me ever until today. <br>
      Whatever... <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 36: Mr Worldwide </h1>
    <p>
      I tried to do some more coursework this morning but I just couldn’t think of anything interesting. <br>
      So I did some more coding instead. <br>
      I don’t need to be amazing at it since I’m not doing Software Engineering, but still. <br>
      Then my one and only lecture today. Me and my mate both agree it’s stupid to come in just for one hour. 
      But we gotta do what we gotta do. There could not have been more than 20 people in that room for a group of almost 90. <br>
      (Business IT students don’t take the Computational Thinking module) <br>
      Then I saw someone from my group project on the train station. <br>
      Actually I had to double check. <br>
      I didn’t want to randomly go up to someone and be like “I know you” 🤣. <br>
      But she’s chill. Kinda quiet too but oh well. <br>
      She asked me “Can you suggest me ways to get better at English?” <br>
      But because of her pronunciation it sounded very different. <br>
      I got very confused and laughed it off with the whole “Oh I thought you said something very different haha”. <br>
      Being able to save yourself mid conversation is a very useful life skill. Way better than differentiating equations. <br>
      You know that tweet that was like: <br>
      “If your life is going well and you start talking to someone of the opposite sex be careful it might be a canon event”. <br>
      I guess I gotta keep my guard up for realsies. <br>
    </p>

    <h1> Day 37: W Rizz?! </h1>
    <p>
      So I’m still talking to someone and she’s alright. <br>
      Saw someone from my secondary school today while I was in the library doing my online course. <br>
      He’s … not mad at me? Maybe he turned a corner. <br>
      After I got McDonald’s I went back to do more StressLess. <br>
      They had Just Dance 3 this time so I was popping off I can’t lie. <br>
      And I think one of the staff members was doing it too, caught them at the corner of my eye. <br>
      I also did more stuff like painting and colouring in. Super relaxing. <br>
      And I learnt more about someone else there too. <br>
      We have the same movie interests in common. <br>
      And we both get called kids coz we don’t look our age 😭 <br>
      Then even more coding! I made a pretty Christmas tree in C#. <br>
      ASCII art is the proper name. <br>
