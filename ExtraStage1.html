    <h1> Extra Stage 1: Placements and Stuff </h1>
    <p>
      I don’t normally go in on Monday but I have a decent reason. <br>
      Nothing interesting happened this morning until Jean showed up. <br>
      Why he didn’t call me I don’t know instead of tap the window glass next to me. <br>
      I’ll never know… <br>
      I’m too focused listening to my sick beats. <br>
      Whatever. Then Ali just randomly calls me in the library. <br> 
      (Luckily I’m in the group zone) and it’s just very awkward and embarrassing. <br>
      My ringtone is loud and very unique. I continue with my coding on Unity and helped Jean with his essay assignment. <br>
      Still have to tweak some of mine but he’s put it fresh in my mind which is good. <br>
      Then in the late afternoon there was this talk about placement years. <br>
      Essentially after your second year of university, <br>
      (If your grades are good enough) <br>
      You have the choice of staying on for third year or going away and working. <br>
      They had some placement students too and it’s definitely got me thinking. <br>
      I’d probably have to move (if I don’t get a placement in London or here) and that’s totally not scary or anything. <br>
      But that’s a problem relatively soon me has to think about because placement opportunities start in October time. <br>
      (Also technically it just has to be at least 30 weeks long, the length of one academic year. Not 52 weeks long.) <br>
      Something to think about, huh. <br>
